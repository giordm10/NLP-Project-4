i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
buttons are too small 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
worked perfectly 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
i love this thing 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
does not fit 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
this game rocks 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
design flaw 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
terrible service 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
piece of junk 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
stay away from the q 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
great for ipods too 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
waitress was good though 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
what a mistake 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
works great 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i am so tired of clich√©s that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
go rent it 1 
the cast is good 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
very easy to use 1 
a good time 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
just does not work 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
50 down the drain 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
overall a great experience 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
works fine 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
nice sound 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
good audio quality 1 
item does not match picture 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
amazon sucks 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
what a waste of time 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
poor sound quality 0 
again lame 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
piece of trash 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
so they performed 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
never got it 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
love this headset 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
good product incredible value 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
good item low price 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
would not reccommend 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it was so cool 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
very poor service 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i would recommend this 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
not impressed 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
an hour seriously 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
works great 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
excellent performance 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
love this headset 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
over rated 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
good food good service 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
overall a delight 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
dont buy it 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
dont buy it 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
not worth it 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
very prompt service 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
so far so good 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
horrible 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
very disappointing 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
awesome device 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
very comfortable 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
youll love it 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman ¬ñ and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
wont go back 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
bad reception 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
nice design and quality 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
good show samsung 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
id like to return it 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
we loved the place 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
it was packed 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
disappointed 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
highly recommended 1 
a standout scene 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
good audio quality 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
its just lame 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the best phone in market 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the problem was the script 0 
i think not again 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
will not be back 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
fantastic food 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
just does not work 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
low quality 0 
a good time 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
its practically perfect in all of them ¬ñ a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
great food 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
dont buy it 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
low quality 0 
its just painful 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
her role was played well 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the food was terrible 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it was so cool 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
poor construction 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
im pleased 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i love this phone 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
item does not match picture 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
disappointed 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
this place lacked style 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it looks very nice 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
will not be back 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
absolutely great 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
happy so far 1 
not good for the money 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
used and dirty 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
dont waste your time 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
very good though 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
defective crap 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
im pleased 1 
does not fit 0 
crust is not good 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i really liked that 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
not impressed 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
excellent phone 1 
a standout scene 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
a good time 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the cr√™pe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
would not reccommend 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
simply beautiful 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
very comfortable 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
the mic is great 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
you wont regret it 1 
horrible 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
id love to go back 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
great earpiece 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
great food 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
crust is not good 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
works great 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
gets the job done 1 
it was awesome 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
good product incredible value 1 
we wont be going back 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
what a waste 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
good product good seller 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
crust is not good 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
awful 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i really liked that 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
delicious 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
the portion was huge 1 
dont buy it 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
food was below average 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
battery has no life 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
it was awesome 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
owners are really great people 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
very good phone 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
sending it back 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
horrible phone 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
i heart this place 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
a great touch 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the best phone in market 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
poor product 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
nothing new there 0 
piece of junk 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the fries were great too 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
piece of trash 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it was not good 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
crust is not good 0 
it looks very nice 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
total waste of time 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
service is also cute 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
wont go back 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
wasted two hours 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the acting was bad 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
my order was not correct 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
yes its that bad 0 
but its just not funny 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
it is shameful 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
i love this thing 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
see it 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
everything stinks 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
great audio 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
great choice 1 
disapointing results 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
service is also cute 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
happy so far 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
disappointed 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
a great touch 1 
wow loved this place 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
good prices 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
best headset ever 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
they have great dinners 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
i heart this place 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
its very slow 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
truly awful 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
they have great dinners 1
