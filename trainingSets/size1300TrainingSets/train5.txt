thank you for wasting my money 0 
awsome device works great 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
great sound and service 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i was mortified 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
it is a true classic 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
nothing special 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
excellent product 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
not my thing 0 
good value great food great service 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
a bit predictable 0 
extremely tasty 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
is pretty funny 1 
happy so far 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
great for ipods too 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
dont go here 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
great phone 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
amazon sucks 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
will never ever go back 0 
too politically correct 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
im returning them 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
does not work 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
very very fun chef 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
food was average at best 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
i want my money back 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
crust is not good 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
con spotty service 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
nothing new there 0 
im pleased 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
nothing new there 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the portion was huge 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
terrible management 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
very comfortable 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
fast service 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
good case 1 
the best phone in market 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
works for me 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
everything stinks 0 
would recommend this item 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
how awful she is 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
i love this thing 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
poor reliability 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
total brunch fail 0 
what a waste of time 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
good audio quality 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
omit watching this 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
battery life is also great 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
good food good service 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
there is no real plot 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
we loved the place 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the design is very good4 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
it works 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the design is very good4 1 
do not waste your time 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
service sucks 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
go rent it 1 
dont buy this product 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
why was this film made 0 
im pleased 1 
great phone 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
food was below average 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
it was packed 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
good quality 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
good item low price 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
price is good too 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the acting was bad 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
lousy product 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
good audio quality 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
im pleased 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
was not happy 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
you wont regret it 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
terrible management 0 
a pretty good product 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this movie is bad 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
gets the job done 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
very poor service 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
great food 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i would recommend this 1 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
bad choice 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
really awful 0 
worthwhile 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it is a true classic 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
brilliant 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the battery works great 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
very good quality though 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
love this phone 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
i love this place 1 
good servicecheck 1 
id love to go back 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
this pda rocks 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
stay away from the q 0 
again lame 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
better than new 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
would not reccommend 0 
does not fit 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
her role was played well 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
they have great dinners 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this is a great deal 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i love this thing 1 
really good product 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i liked it 1 
good case 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
it was so funny 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
great price too 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
mediocre food 0 
what a waste 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i am very happy 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
good works fine 1 
50 down the drain 0 
disappointed 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
i consider this theft 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
well im satisfied 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
great sound and service 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
battery life is real good 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
used and dirty 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
it just blew 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
sending it back 0 
omit watching this 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
so far so good 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
great earpiece 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
that was nice 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
very disappointing 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
the management is rude 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
will order from them again 1 
very disappointing 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
buttons are too small 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this is a great deal 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this case seems well made 1 
did not like at all 0 
everything was gross 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
battery life is also great 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
we loved the place 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
design flaw 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
overall a delight 1 
well never go again 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
nice design and quality 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the food was terrible 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
worthwhile 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this pda rocks 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
its just lame 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
damn good steak 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
how awesome is that 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
its very slow 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
love this phone 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i love this thing 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
gets the job done 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
the management is rude 0 
worked great 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
sending it back 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
never going back 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
dont miss it 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
just does not work 0 
the reception is excellent 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
dont waste your money 0 
no plot whatsoever 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
works good 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the acting sucked 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
good case excellent value 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
really awful 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i waited and waited 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
dont go here 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
worth every penny 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
it was horrendous 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
damn good steak 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
dont buy this product 0 
im pleased 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
yes its that bad 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
portable and it works 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
great audio 1 
really bad 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
im returning them 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
you wont regret it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
it was equally awful 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
it was horrendous 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
it worked very well 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
works great 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
great product and price 1 
love it great armband 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
good value great food great service 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
very easy to use 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
great value 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
left very frustrated 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
it is a true classic 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the acting sucked 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
very disappointing 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was awesome 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
over rated 0 
dont waste your money 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
best headset ever 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
disappointed 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
well im satisfied 1 
terrible management 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
fantastic service here 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
works fine 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
see it 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
poor reliability 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the battery works great 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
it is a true classic 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
fast service 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
dont do it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
food was delicious 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
nice leather 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
worthless product 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the fries were great too 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
both great 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
its very slow 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
gets the job done 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0
