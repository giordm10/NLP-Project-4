as i said abovepretty useless 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
excellent service 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the management is rude 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
food was delicious 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
overall a delight 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
i think not again 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
great product 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
very good phone 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
never got it 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
it just blew 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it was horrendous 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
service is also cute 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
its just lame 0 
the script is bad very bad Â– it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
not a good bargain 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
disappointing 0 
its aggravating 0 
a disappointment 0 
dont buy this product 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
will not be back 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
the food amazing 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the problem was the script 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
worthless product 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i love this phone 1 
did not like at all 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
a pretty good product 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
my order was not correct 0 
this place lacked style 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
good food good service 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
great phone 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
go to place for gyros 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
never got it 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
a standout scene 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was packed 0 
cumbersome design 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
but i dont like it 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
see it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
really ugly 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the service was meh 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
just does not work 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
cumbersome design 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
im returning them 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
works good 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
overall a delight 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
service sucks 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichÃ©s thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
camera color balance is awful 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
used and dirty 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
why was this film made 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
excellent service 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
my order was not correct 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
great value 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
bad reception 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
design flaw 0 
great price also 1 
best headset ever 1 
great earpiece 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
good prices 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
great product and price 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
so they performed 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
not easy to watch 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
you wont regret it 1 
magical help 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
has been working great 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
dont buy it 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
not worth it 0 
great phone 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
awful service 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
its not user friendly 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
again lame 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
magical help 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
bad choice 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
happy so far 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i was mortified 0 
magical help 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
warning stay away 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
will order from them again 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
the phone loads super 1 
worst customer service 0 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
con spotty service 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
lousy product 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
great value 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
price is good too 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
good audio quality 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
hated it 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
absolutel junk 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the block was amazing 1 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
doesnt last long 0 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
the food amazing 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
highly recommended 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
great sound and service 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
everything was gross 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
owners are really great people 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the best phone in market 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the management is rude 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
everything was gross 0 
check it out 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
excellent 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
but i dont like it 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
its very slow 0 
works good 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
excellent performance 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
it is shameful 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
that was nice 1 
this place is amazing 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
overall a delight 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i would recommend this 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
excellent 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
bad reception 0 
worst phone ever 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
it was horrendous 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
not recommended 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
the cast was great 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
fantastic food 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
1010 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
totally believable 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
really awful 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
very very sad 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
will order from them again 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
would not go back 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
really good product 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
what a waste of time 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the food was very good 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
just what i wanted 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great value 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
cool phone 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
works great 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
wasted two hours 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
really ugly 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
good case excellent value 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
nothing special 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
will never ever go back 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
no real improvement 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
price is good too 1 
great product 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
a good time 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
a disappointment 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
terrible management 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i never come again 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
worked great 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the fries were great too 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
better than new 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
nice design and quality 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
battery life is also great 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it is shameful 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
too politically correct 0 
its pretty easy 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
great sound and service 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
its really easy 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
does not work 0 
nothing special 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
very good though 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
its just lame 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
good product incredible value 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
worst customer service 0 
it was awesome 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
would not go back 0 
that was nice 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i liked it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
dont go here 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
not good for the money 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
highly recommended a 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this place is amazing 1 
not what i wanted 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
never going back 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i would recommend it 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
he was terrible 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
it was so funny 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
great phone 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
worst thai ever 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
you wont regret it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i love this place 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
fantastic service here 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
works good 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
works well 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it was awesome 1 
great product 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
this place has it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
will definitely be back 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
a good time 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
highly recommended 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
go and see it 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1
