everything stinks 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
both great 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
this is a great deal 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
best headset ever 1 
worth every penny 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the fries were great too 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
dont buy this product 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
1010 1 
nothing special 0 
it was delicious 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
but i dont like it 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
overall a great experience 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
you wont regret it 1 
food was delicious 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
is pretty funny 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
doesnt work 0 
battery is terrible 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
great product and price 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this is a great little item 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
waste of money 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
will definitely be back 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
great phone 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
worth every penny 1 
great product for the price 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
does not work 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
left very frustrated 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the management is rude 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
how awesome is that 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
it was packed 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not a good bargain 0 
give this one a look 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
great sound and service 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
good show samsung 1 
has been working great 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
great price too 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
warning do not buy 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
worth every penny 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is a great phone 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
so they performed 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
this pda rocks 1 
works great 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i was so insulted 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
the battery works great 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
love this product 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
works for me 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the acting sucked 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
doesnt work 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
not what i wanted 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
he was terrible 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
great price too 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
would not reccommend 0 
it was delicious 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
good product good seller 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great for ipods too 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
it was packed 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
everything was gross 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
service was fantastic 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
i paid too much 0 
disapointing results 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
it is a true classic 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
very funny 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
good case 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
works fine 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
omit watching this 0 
disappointing experience 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
i liked it 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
truly awful 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
how awesome is that 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
best headset ever 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
damn good steak 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
best headset ever 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
absolutel junk 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
bad choice 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
very displeased 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
this game rocks 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
it is a true classic 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
very bad experience 0 
very bad experience 0 
works good 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i waited and waited 0 
the poor actors 0 
brilliant 1 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
good value great food great service 1 
very very fun chef 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
this is a great deal 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it was equally awful 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the food was very good 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
great price too 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
works great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
horrible phone 0 
dont waste your money 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
i paid too much 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
we wont be returning 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the service was meh 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
crisp and clear 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
very disappointed 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
the mic is great 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
magical help 1 
food was below average 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
piece of junk 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
im super pissd 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this game rocks 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
will be back again 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
the mic is great 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
i will not return 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
warning stay away 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
also great directing and photography 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i love this phone 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
well never go again 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
used and dirty 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
mediocre food 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
the food amazing 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
the acting was bad 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
stay away from the q 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
but i dont like it 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
not recommended 0 
this phone works great 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
very disappointed 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
very good product well made 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i love it 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
well im satisfied 1 
fantastic service here 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
worst ever 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the fries were great too 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
excellent 1 
good quality 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
go watch it 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the food amazing 1 
worked great 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it was packed 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
why was this film made 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
youll love it 1 
the phone loads super 1 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
truly awful 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
both great 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
i never come again 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
highly recommended 1 
good case 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
item does not match picture 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
design flaw 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
it was not good 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
very easy to use 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the mic is great 1 
good case 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
well im satisfied 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
design flaw 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
great earpiece 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
service was very prompt 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
dont go here 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
great product for the price 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
very windresistant 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the management is rude 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
service sucks 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
my order was not correct 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
this place is great 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
dont waste your time 0 
works for me 1 
very friendly staff 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
the food is good 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
so bad 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
good food good service 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
better than youd expect 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
wasted two hours 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
very happy with this product 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
brilliant 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
wow loved this place 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
everything was gross 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
so far so good 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
really good product 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i want my money back 0 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
great phone 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
doesnt work 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great price also 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i heart this place 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
has been working great 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
a pretty good product 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
nothing special 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
very comfortable 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
very displeased 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0
