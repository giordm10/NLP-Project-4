this is a great phone 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
it was awesome 1 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
youll love it 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
very very fun chef 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
it was way over fried 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
this place is good 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
bad choice 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
poor construction 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
not worth it 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it was not good 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
piece of junk 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
left very frustrated 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
dont waste your money 0 
bad purchase 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
not good for the money 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
service sucks 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
check it out 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
too politically correct 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
youll love how thin it is 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i loved it 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
check it out 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i would recommend it 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
magical help 1 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
both great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
wont go back 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it was horrible 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i heart this place 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
wasted two hours 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
amazon sucks 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
go rent it 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i am very happy 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
excellent product 1 
the food amazing 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
works great 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
worst phone ever 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
the acting was bad 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
go rent it 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this case seems well made 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
wont go back 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
mediocre food 0 
really awful 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
this place is disgusting 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
cumbersome design 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
does not fit 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
works as described 1 
i wont be back 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the block was amazing 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
this movie is also revealing 1 
very good though 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
very easy to use 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
service is also cute 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
the phone loads super 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
they have great dinners 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
great hands free device 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
excellent short film 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
great food 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is infuriating 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
used and dirty 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
mediocre food 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
give this one a look 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
he was terrible 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
excellent 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
it was a great phone 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
my order was not correct 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
go and see it 1 
excellent phone 1 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
did not like at all 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
these are fabulous 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
it was horrendous 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
very displeased 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it is not good 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
food was delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
excellent 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
service sucks 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the acting was bad 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
there is no real plot 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
terrible service 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great value 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
very disappointed 0 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
we are sending it back 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
piece of junk 0 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
last time buying from you 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
it is shameful 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
con spotty service 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
it was horrible 0 
great product for the price 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
go watch it 1 
food was really boring 0 
that company is a joke 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
did not like at all 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
excellent short film 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
good value great food great service 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
this is a great phone 1 
great food 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
good case 1 
works great 1 
lightweight and works well 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
great choice 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
very prompt service 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i love this device 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
never going back 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
these are fabulous 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
would not reccommend 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
great phone 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i really liked that 1 
amazon sucks 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
it is not good 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
over rated 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
will order from them again 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i was so insulted 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
check it out 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
my order was not correct 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
i paid too much 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it was equally awful 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
great service and food 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
disappointed 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
will never ever go back 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
very good quality though 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
youll love it 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
you wont regret it 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
great price also 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
we are sending it back 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
great price also 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
poor reliability 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i consider this theft 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
not what i wanted 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
go and see it 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
great price also 1 
works as described 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
good show samsung 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
will never ever go back 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
fantastic service here 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
better than new 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
poor construction 0 
this is a great phone 1 
i would recommend it 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
better than expected 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
works well 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
battery life is real good 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
service stinks here 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
do not waste your time 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
awful 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
not recommended 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
very disappointing 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
used and dirty 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
excellent service 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
good case 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
awful 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
was not happy 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
krussel always good 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
disappointing 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
totally believable 1 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
too politically correct 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
not my thing 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the food amazing 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
better than new 1 
these are fabulous 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
love it great armband 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the acting was bad 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
the service was meh 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
excellent service 1 
food was really boring 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
absolutel junk 0 
its just lame 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
1010 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
does not work 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
really bad 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it is not good 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
battery life is real good 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
a good time 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the design is very good4 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it was horrible 0 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
1010 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
great price too 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
this game rocks 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
good product incredible value 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
sooooo good 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
i would recommend it 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
great phone 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
damn good steak 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
no complaints 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
battery life is real good 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
great price too 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the food was terrible 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
has been working great 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
left very frustrated 0
