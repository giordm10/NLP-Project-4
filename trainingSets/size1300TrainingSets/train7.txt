good prices 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
a good time 1 
im pleased 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
what a disappointment 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
just what i wanted 1 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
you wont forget this movie 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
great hands free device 1 
this place lacked style 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
its not user friendly 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
overall a delight 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
it was delicious 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
works great 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
great phone 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
the food is good 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
poor reliability 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
service is also cute 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
nice sound 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i liked it 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
highly recommended a 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
poor construction 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
will definitely be back 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
service was fantastic 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
very good product well made 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
has been working great 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
fantastic food 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
worthless product 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
good product incredible value 1 
wasted two hours 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
very good product well made 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
worked perfectly 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
battery life is also great 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
a standout scene 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
too politically correct 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
magical help 1 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
has been working great 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i consider this theft 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
very good though 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
well never go again 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
i loved it 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the burrittos blah 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
great phone 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it looks very nice 1 
wasted two hours 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
the acting was bad 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
works great 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
great product and price 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
it is an insane game 1 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
magical help 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
sending it back 0 
good price 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
very good phone 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
its not user friendly 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
service was fantastic 1 
would not go back 0 
great audio 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
disappointed 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
well im satisfied 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
so just beware 0 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
battery life is real good 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
excellent performance 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
good audio quality 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the worst one of the series 0 
was not happy 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
very disappointed 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
great earpiece 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
delicious 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
would recommend this item 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
item does not match picture 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
incredible 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
you cant beat that 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
very good product well made 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
my order was not correct 0 
very disappointing 0 
eclectic selection 1 
gets the job done 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
awful 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
wont go back 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
it was delicious 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
service is also cute 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
see both films if you can 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
this game rocks 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
how stupid is that 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
there is no real plot 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
both great 1 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
very friendly staff 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i love this thing 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
go rent it 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
yes its that bad 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
it was so boring 0 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
great for ipods too 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
total waste of time 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
terrible management 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
damn good steak 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
bad quality 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i never come again 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
check it out 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
works fine 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the cast was great 1 
i waited and waited 0 
works well 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
there is no real plot 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
the food was very good 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
works fine 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
dont waste your money 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
dont go here 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i think not again 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
buttons are too small 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
great service and food 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
does not fit 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
it looks very nice 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
good case excellent value 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
im super pissd 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
total waste of time 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
we wont be returning 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
is pretty funny 1 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
does not fit 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
well im satisfied 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
good prices 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
its a total package 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
there is no real plot 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
the portion was huge 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i love this thing 1 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
never got it 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
battery has no life 0 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
battery life is real good 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
painful on the ear 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
very poor service 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
does not work 0 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
worst martini ever 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
fantastic food 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
piece of trash 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
not recommended 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
everything stinks 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the acting was bad 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
service stinks here 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
truly awful 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
eclectic selection 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
these are fabulous 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
nothing special 0 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
very good product well made 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
i love this device 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
not recommended 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
nothing new there 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
works great 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
good item low price 1 
horrible phone 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
piece of junk 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
works well 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
see both films if you can 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
incredible 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
disapointing results 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
incredible 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
awful 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
that movie was bad 0 
youll love it 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
works great 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
im returning them 0 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
disappointed 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
very very sad 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0
