useless phone simply deaf 0 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
its pretty easy 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
great price also 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
works as described 1 
con spotty service 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
dont do it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
works great 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
we wont be returning 0 
very disappointed 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
you wont regret it 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
total brunch fail 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
great phone 1 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
youll love it 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
dont buy it 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
dont go here 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
piece of trash 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
id like to return it 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
crisp and clear 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
good price 1 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
again no plot at all 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
you cant beat that 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
its just lame 0 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
overall a delight 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
awesome device 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
good servicecheck 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it was horrible 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
dont buy this product 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
lousy product 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
would not reccommend 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
this is a great little item 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the phone loads super 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
my order was not correct 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
see it 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
gets the job done 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
love this headset 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
truly awful 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
what a mistake 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
absolutel junk 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
horrible 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the mic is great 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
very prompt service 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
we wont be returning 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
great phone 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the mic is great 1 
good case 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
love it great armband 1 
dont buy it 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
left very frustrated 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
a disappointment 0 
great choice 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i would recommend this 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
love this phone 1 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
love this headset 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
i think not again 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
fast service 1 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
go watch it 1 
dont buy this product 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
im returning them 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
battery has no life 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
love this phone 1 
i was mortified 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
disappointing experience 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
these are fabulous 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
eclectic selection 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
very good phone 1 
i love this thing 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
very comfortable 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
will definitely be back 1 
love this phone 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
im returning them 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
will definitely be back 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
poor sound quality 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
battery life is also great 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
doesnt work 0 
these are fabulous 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
worthless product 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
great price also 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
nice ambiance 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
the food amazing 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
why was this film made 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
did not like at all 0 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
i loved it 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it was not good 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
very poor service 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
doesnt work 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
its really easy 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
it is an insane game 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
this phone works great 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
check it out 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
the food was terrible 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
not recommended 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
im super pissd 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
mediocre food 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
the food is good 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
awesome device 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
works good 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
really bad 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
never going back 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
its pretty easy 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
see it 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
does not fit 0 
go rent it 1 
item does not match picture 0 
will not be back 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
nice ambiance 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
great hands free device 1 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
portable and it works 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
the best phone in market 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
damn good steak 1 
its a great item 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
either way it sucks 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
this place is great 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
will not be back 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
price is good too 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
best headset ever 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
couldnt figure it out 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
works good 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
im pleased 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
well never go again 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
my order was not correct 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
battery life is real good 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
item does not match picture 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
this place is good 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
so they performed 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
i never come again 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
it is a true classic 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
good transmit audio 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
nice ambiance 1 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
well never go again 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
poor construction 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
worked great 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
damn good steak 1 
the film is way too long 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
you cant beat that 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
total waste of time 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
i consider this theft 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i heart this place 1 
kind of flops around 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the acting was bad 0 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
horrible phone 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
total waste of time 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
the service was meh 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the phone loads super 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
absolutel junk 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
well never go again 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
a good time 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
sooooo good 1 
low quality 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
too politically correct 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
soyo technology sucks 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i love this device 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
great bluetooth 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i love this place 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
krussel always good 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
horrible 0 
this is a great phone 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
fantastic food 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
good case excellent value 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the portion was huge 1 
nice design and quality 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
nice leather 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
well im satisfied 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
good product incredible value 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
worst martini ever 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
better than expected 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
crisp and clear 1 
it has all the features i want 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
great charger 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
highly recommended a 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
bad quality 0 
eclectic selection 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very disappointing 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1
