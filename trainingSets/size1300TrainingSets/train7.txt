nice solid keyboard 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
the design is very good4 1 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
i love it 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you cant beat that 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
so just beware 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
im super pissd 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
the block was amazing 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
dont buy it 0 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
over rated 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
the fries were great too 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
good product incredible value 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
the management is rude 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
i really liked that 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
this is a great phone 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
bad purchase 0 
it was horrendous 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
well never go again 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
i was so insulted 0 
it is an insane game 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
poor quality 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
dont waste your money 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
it was horrendous 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
five star plus plus 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
works great 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
wont go back 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
very good phone 1 
the service was meh 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
works great 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
the fries were great too 1 
very disappointing 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
really good product 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
worst thai ever 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
overall a great experience 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
awesome device 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
this place has it 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
it was horrendous 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
we loved the place 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
long whiny and pointless 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
great audio 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
has been working great 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
im not eating here 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
nice ambiance 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the cast is good 1 
dont waste your time 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
great product and price 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
good price 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
penne vodka excellent 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
that was nice 1 
dont miss it 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
i wont be back 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
low quality 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
i will not return 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
excellent short film 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
not easy to watch 0 
is pretty funny 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
the food is good 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i will not return 0 
it was equally awful 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it was way over fried 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
price is good too 1 
good product incredible value 1 
this game rocks 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
bad purchase 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
very poor service 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
service stinks here 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
awful 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
dont do it 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
good show samsung 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
im not eating here 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i love this device 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
well never go again 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
highly recommended a 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
the design is very good4 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
incredible 1 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
mediocre food 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
fantastic service here 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
great product and price 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
great brunch spot 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
i paid too much 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
nice design and quality 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
they have great dinners 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
very good phone 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
i love this thing 1 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it is shameful 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
great product and price 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
poor construction 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
very poor service 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
we wont be going back 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
good value great food great service 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
this is a great phone 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
stay away from the q 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
not worth it 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
we wont be going back 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was not good 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
doesnt work 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
nice leather 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i will not return 0 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
wow loved this place 1 
owners are really great people 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
nothing special 0 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
dont go here 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
crust is not good 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
i am very happy 1 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the service was meh 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
poor product 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
awesome device 1 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
truly awful 0 
this is a good joint 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
it works 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
excellent hands free tool 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
mediocre food 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
works for me 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
extremely tasty 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
terrible service 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
comfortable in my hand 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
that was nice 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
i heart this place 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
the food is good 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
well im satisfied 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
great value 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
great phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it worked very well 1 
very good though 1 
worst ever 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
great brunch spot 1 
nice ambiance 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
easy to use 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
worst customer service 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
wow loved this place 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
love this headset 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this phone works great 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
sweetest phone 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
will definitely be back 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
has been working great 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
i waited and waited 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
awsome device works great 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
a disappointment 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i will not return 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i was mortified 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
an hour seriously 0 
i consider this theft 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
i liked it 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i consider this theft 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the food was terrible 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
horrible phone 0 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
owners are really great people 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
excellent phone 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
pretty piece of junk 0 
the design is very good4 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
would not reccommend 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
food was delicious 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
made very sturdy 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
good works fine 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
the results well are a shame 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
not enough volume 0 
works great 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the block was amazing 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
youll love it 1 
poor construction 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
both great 1 
its a total package 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
its not user friendly 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
works well 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
just what i wanted 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
it is a true classic 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
this place is good 1 
hated it 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
food was really boring 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its a great item 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
i want my money back 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
pretty awesome place 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
we wont be returning 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
doesnt do the job 0 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
what a waste 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
dont waste your time 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
see it 1 
bad reception 0 
sweetest phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
so bad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
very happy with this product 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the poor actors 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i am very happy 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
very disappointing 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
great service and food 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the film is way too long 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
love it great armband 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
a great touch 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
1010 1 
it was so boring 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
amazon sucks 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
it worked very well 1 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
absolutely great 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
really good product 1 
works great 1 
i really liked that 1 
it was so funny 1 
bad reception 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
so they performed 1 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
it was awesome 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
dont waste your money 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0
