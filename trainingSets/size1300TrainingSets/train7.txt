im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
food was delicious 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
very good phone 1 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i liked it 1 
very friendly staff 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
very good product well made 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
great phone 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
really ugly 0 
so far so good 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
excellent phone 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
a good time 1 
looks great and is strong 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
the cast was great 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
how stupid is that 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
dont miss it 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
its just lame 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
dont miss it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
really bad 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
not recommended 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the food amazing 1 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i love this place 1 
we wont be going back 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the best phone in market 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
superb phone on a great network 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
wasted two hours 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
was not happy 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
never going back 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
wasted two hours 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
i was not happy with this item 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
terrible service 0 
works fine 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
good product good seller 1 
you wont regret it 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its not user friendly 0 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
stay away from the q 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
her role was played well 1 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
never got it 0 
absolutely great 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
excellent product 1 
the management is rude 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the design is very good4 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
doesnt work 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
worthwhile 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
worked perfectly 1 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
item does not match picture 0 
again lame 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
wow loved this place 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
crust is not good 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
terrible service 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
dont waste your time 0 
poor quality 0 
this is a great deal 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
awesome service and food 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
1010 1 
great phone 1 
service stinks here 0 
the film is way too long 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
love this product 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
not a good bargain 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
good food good service 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
a standout scene 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
worst customer service ever 0 
nothing new there 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
he was terrible 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
good show samsung 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
well im satisfied 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
go watch it 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
id love to go back 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
dont buy this product 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
battery is terrible 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
works great 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
these are fabulous 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
it was not good 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
great phone 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
eclectic selection 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
so bad 0 
dont buy it 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
worst ever 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
great hands free device 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
why was this film made 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
great value 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
not worth it 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
its a total package 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
i enjoyed it 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i am very happy 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
i love this device 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
better than youd expect 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
works fine 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
simply beautiful 1 
nice ambiance 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
it is a joy to use 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
never going back 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
very friendly staff 1 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
what a waste 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
good audio quality 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
youll love it 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
nice ambiance 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i never come again 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
what a waste 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
and the sound quality is great 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
very prompt service 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the acting sucked 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
not worth it 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
owners are really great people 1 
highly recommended 1 
good case excellent value 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
disapointing results 0 
worst customer service 0 
krussel always good 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
nothing new there 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
battery has no life 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
just what i wanted 1 
what a waste 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
wow loved this place 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
how awful she is 0 
do not waste your money here 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
id love to go back 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it was way over fried 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
worst customer service 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
im pleased 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
dont bother go to the store 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
simply beautiful 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this place is amazing 1 
the problem was the script 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
we wont be returning 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
good product good seller 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
very good quality though 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i heart this place 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
poor reliability 0 
over rated 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
so they performed 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
a pretty good product 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
highly recommended 1 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the food amazing 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
will never ever go back 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
1010 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
really good product 1 
great product for the price 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
no real improvement 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
nothing new there 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
good item low price 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
the problem was the script 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
great phone 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
the reception has been generally good 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the design is very good4 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
disappointed 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
will not be back 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
absolutely great 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
bad fit way too big 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the acting sucked 0 
amazon sucks 0 
very disappointing 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
everything was gross 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
con spotty service 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
1010 1 
we loved the place 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
awesome service and food 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
the food is good 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
good transmit audio 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
an hour seriously 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
the block was amazing 1 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
brilliant 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
everything was gross 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
is pretty funny 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it was delicious 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the management is rude 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
my order was not correct 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
poor quality 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
disappointed 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i never come again 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
service was very prompt 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
really ugly 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
not impressed 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
you cant beat that 1 
the battery works great 1 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
highly recommended a 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
im returning them 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
nice solid keyboard 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
wasted two hours 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
dont buy it 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
they have great dinners 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
i heart this place 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
great service and food 1 
good product good seller 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
very happy with this product 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
portable and it works 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
this pda rocks 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
great phone 1 
very happy with this product 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
good item low price 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1
