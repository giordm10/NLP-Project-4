no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
the food was terrible 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it was so boring 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
will never ever go back 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great phone 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
awesome device 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
bad purchase 0 
it was a great phone 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
what a mistake that was 0 
good quality 1 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
good product incredible value 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
design flaw 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this is a good joint 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
dont waste your money 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
no complaints 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
no real improvement 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
he was terrible 0 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
not my thing 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
the food wasnt good 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
used and dirty 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
excellent 1 
again lame 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
horrible horrible protector 0 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
incredible 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
very disappointed 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
it was just too horrible 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
very displeased 0 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
it looks very nice 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
worthless product 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
the food is good 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
good prices 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
great food 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
sending it back 0 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
piece of trash 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
very good quality though 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i really liked that 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
so far so good 1 
the script is was there a script 0 
dont waste your money 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
very comfortable 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this is a great phone 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the problem was the script 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
i wont be back 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
just what i wanted 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
warning stay away 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
food was really boring 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
the acting sucked 0 
again lame 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
good show samsung 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
so they performed 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
poor sound quality 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
omit watching this 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great brunch spot 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
great brunch spot 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
yes its that bad 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
con spotty service 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
used and dirty 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the fries were great too 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
would not reccommend 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
it was so funny 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
warning stay away 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
will not be back 0 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
the block was amazing 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i am very happy 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
poor sound quality 0 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
today the graphics are crap 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
why was this film made 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
does not work 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great phone 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
that company is a joke 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
great phone 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the fries were great too 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
great charger 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i wont be back 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
sooooo good 1 
good product good seller 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
works great 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it was awesome 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
that company is a joke 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
used and dirty 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
sprint charges for this service 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
food was below average 0 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
works as described 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
dont buy it 0 
overall a great experience 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
absolutel junk 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
good product good seller 1 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
a great touch 1 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
you cant beat that 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
dont bother coming here 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
everything was gross 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
that movie was bad 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
good food good service 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
not recommended 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
50 down the drain 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
kind of flops around 0 
dont waste your money 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
nothing special 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
the service was not up to par either 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
very disappointing 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the best phone in market 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
1010 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
magical help 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
nice design and quality 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
youll love it 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
go watch it 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
worst martini ever 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
simply beautiful 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
very good phone 1 
excellent performance 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
great phone 1 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
piece of junk 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i am very happy 1 
great phone 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
great hands free device 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
great product fast shipping 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the food was terrible 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
dont waste your time 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
waitress was good though 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
great charger 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
great brunch spot 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
good product incredible value 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
i would recommend this 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
service was very prompt 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the food was terrible 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
great price also 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
brilliant 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
eclectic selection 1 
works good 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
overall a delight 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
highly recommended a 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
lots of holes in the script 0 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
im not eating here 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
bad reception 0 
good show samsung 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
go watch it 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
was not happy 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
an hour seriously 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
great product 1 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
im so happy to be here 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
check it out 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
excellent performance 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i would recommend this 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
total brunch fail 0 
did not like at all 0 
i liked it 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
well never go again 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i was so insulted 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
bad quality 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
very disappointed 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
ambience is perfect 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
it just blew 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
owners are really great people 1 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
we loved the place 1 
very friendly staff 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
awesome service and food 1 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
very disappointing 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
sending it back 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
how stupid is that 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
very friendly staff 1 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
great product 1 
service was very prompt 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
service was very prompt 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i wont be back 0 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
you cant beat that 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
go watch it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this phone works great 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i love this device 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
overall a delight 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
a good time 1 
i love this phone 1 
the phone loads super 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
magical help 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
it was a great phone 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
this is a great deal 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
well never go again 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
worthless product 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
i love this thing 1 
does not work 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i really liked that 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0
