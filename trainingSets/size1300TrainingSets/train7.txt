simple lightweight and great fit 1 
poor construction 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
worst ever 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
works great 1 
excellent service 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
the cast is good 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
good item low price 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
good prices 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
the story line is just awful 0 
this is a good joint 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
highly recommended 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
her role was played well 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
food was delicious 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
excellent 1 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
fantastic service here 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
a good time 1 
lousy product 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
doesnt last long 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
hes a national treasure 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
very disappointing 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
this is infuriating 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
better than expected 1 
i never come again 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
love it great armband 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
horrible phone 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
its a great item 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
over rated 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
over rated 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
really awful 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
great value 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
this case seems well made 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
well never go again 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
i never come again 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
item does not match picture 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
i waited and waited 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
better than expected 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
cool phone 1 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
very windresistant 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the kids are annoying 0 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
doesnt hold charge 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
poor construction 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
i consider this theft 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
cumbersome design 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
five star plus plus 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
will definitely be back 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
total brunch fail 0 
will not be back 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the food amazing 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
good prices 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
they were excellent 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
dont waste your money 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
these are fabulous 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
will order from them again 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
dont buy it 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
i will not return 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
amazon sucks 0 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
this place is good 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
damn good steak 1 
not my thing 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
love this phone 1 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
will never ever go back 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
yes its that bad 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
absolutel junk 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
is pretty funny 1 
excellent product 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
portable and it works 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
good food good service 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
it is a true classic 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
bad purchase 0 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
very disappointing 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
not easy to watch 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
freezes frequently4 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
wasted two hours 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
design flaw 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
nice ambiance 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
low quality 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
it was awesome 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
price is good too 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
will never ever go back 0 
great phone 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
wont go back 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
great phone 1 
the food is good 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
i am very happy 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i will not return 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
crust is not good 0 
works fine 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
brilliant 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i liked it 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i was mortified 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
just what i wanted 1 
exactly what i wanted 1 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
really bad 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great product 1 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
the best phone in market 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the manager was the worst 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
sooooo good 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
truly awful 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
incredible 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it also had a new problem 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
the cast was great 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
great charger 1 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
really good product 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it looks very nice 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
bt50 battery junk 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
im not eating here 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
that company is a joke 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
we loved the place 1 
it was so cool 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
fast service 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
ray charles is legendary 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
it was not good 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
service was good and the company was better 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
nice ambiance 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
no complaints 1 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
we wont be returning 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
food was delicious 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great brunch spot 1 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
very disappointing 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
did not like at all 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
it just blew 0 
it was so cool 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
i love this thing 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
i am very happy 1 
over rated 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
love this phone 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
she carries the movie well 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
really good product 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
they are so cool 1 
again lame 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
the acting was bad 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
good food good service 1 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
piece of junk 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
how stupid is that 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
great hands free device 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
bad quality 0 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
piece of junk 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
this is a great deal 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
food was average at best 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
you cant beat that 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
everything was gross 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
dont buy it 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
service is also cute 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
very disappointing 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
horrible phone 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
owners are really great people 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
this movie is bad 0 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
very good though 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
a disappointment 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
brilliant 1 
it just blew 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
but its just not funny 0 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
warning stay away 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i was so insulted 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
sending it back 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
great product and price 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
well never go again 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
that was nice 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
just what i wanted 1 
gets the job done 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
bad purchase 0 
does not fit 0 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
very disappointing 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great product 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
krussel always good 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
very disappointing 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
dont waste your money 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
very very sad 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i love this place 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
the film is way too long 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
dont miss it 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
great phone 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
great hands free device 1 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
left very frustrated 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
great phone 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
highly recommended a 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
easy to use 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i rate this movie 910 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
will definitely be back 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
great product 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the nachos are a must have 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
so badwellits just bad 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
terrible management 0 
fast service 1 
crisp and clear 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
battery is terrible 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this is a great little item 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
excellent phone 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
1010 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this is a great phone 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
bad reception 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
the phone loads super 1 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
its aggravating 0 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
worthless product 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0
