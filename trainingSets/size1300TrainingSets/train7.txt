the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
an hour seriously 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
her role was played well 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
would recommend this item 1 
great product 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
works as described 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
absolutel junk 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
very disappointed 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
i love it 1 
works for me 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
does not fit 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
i love this device 1 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
very disappointed 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this place is great 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
i waited and waited 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
will not be back 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
is pretty funny 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
go watch it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
worth every penny 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
50 down the drain 0 
nice design and quality 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
but i dont like it 0 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
this case seems well made 1 
better than new 1 
what a disappointment 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
excellent 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
nice sound 1 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
you cant beat that 1 
well never go again 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
i heart this place 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
its very slow 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
will be back again 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
the acting was bad 0 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
nargile i think you are great 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
great phone 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
check it out 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
go rent it 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
this case seems well made 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
best breakfast buffet 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
please dont waste your money 0 
w810i is just superb 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
fantastic service here 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
this fixes all the problems 1 
omit watching this 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
reasonably priced also 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
so just beware 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
poor quality 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
very easy to use 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
better than expected 1 
great phone 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
portable and it works 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
awesome service and food 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
that company is a joke 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
buttons are too small 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
nice headset priced right 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
50 down the drain 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
the cast is good 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
do not waste your time 0 
its pure brilliance 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
great choice 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
awesome device 1 
price is good too 1 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the visual effects were awful 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
worked great 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
stay away from the q 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
im returning them 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
it was so funny 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
were jerks on the phone 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
this is a great little item 1 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
waitress was good though 1 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
but its just not funny 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
they were excellent 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
easy to use 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
i was mortified 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
what a waste 0 
doesnt last long 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
works fine 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
the fries were great too 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i would highly recommend this 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
again lame 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
excellent service 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
poor product 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
made very sturdy 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
the best phone in market 1 
this place has it 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
not easy to watch 0 
wont go back 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
disappointed 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
poor construction 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
it is not good 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
absolutel junk 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
excellent short film 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i want my money back 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
very bad experience 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
great product 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is a great deal 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
used and dirty 0 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the mic is great 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
very displeased 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
great food 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i love it 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the poor actors 0 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
amazon sucks 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
not my thing 0 
not what i wanted 0 
very good phone 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
dont miss it 1 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
awesome device 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
service was fantastic 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
wow loved this place 1 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
good value great food great service 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
excellent phone 1 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
im returning them 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
very happy with this product 1 
this case seems well made 1 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i liked it 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
disapointing results 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
not recommended 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
fantastic food 1 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
waiter was a jerk 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
its not what it says it is 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the fries were great too 1 
works as described 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
there is no real plot 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
i want my money back 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
amazon sucks 0 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
we wont be returning 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
great bluetooth 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
i consider this theft 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
does not fit 0 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
so they performed 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
1010 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
good item low price 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i love this device 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
a good film by a great director 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
it was a great phone 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
it was so cool 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
he was terrible 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
id love to go back 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
a truly truly bad film 0 
the phone loads super 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the design is very good4 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
this is infuriating 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
their chow mein is so good 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
great brunch spot 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
love this product 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
totally believable 1 
do not purchase this phone 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
terrible management 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
works fine 1 
poor reliability 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
very disappointing 0 
it looks very nice 1 
it was not good 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
so far so good 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
its not user friendly 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
good food good service 1 
the food is good 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
50 down the drain 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
the cast was great 1 
five star plus plus 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
over rated 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great bluetooth 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
better than expected 1 
not recommended 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i consider this theft 0 
dont waste your on this one 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
what a waste of money and time 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
1010 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
the design is very good4 1 
poor quality 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
it was packed 0 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
really ugly 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
very windresistant 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
poor quality 0 
great value 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
has been working great 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the food was very good 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
dont buy this product 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
i hate movies like that 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
very disappointing 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
made very sturdy 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
1010 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
i love this device 1 
its a total package 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
very good phone 1 
we are sending it back 0 
did not like at all 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it was so cool 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
waitress was good though 1 
simply beautiful 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
id like to return it 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the food is good 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
50 down the drain 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
good prices 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
very disappointing 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
very comfortable 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
not recommended 0 
its very slow 0 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
it is not good 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
great food and awesome service 1 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
its a piece of crap 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
nice leather 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
best headset ever 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
nice leather 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
good works fine 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
disappointed 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
i loved it 1 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
very disappointed 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
cool phone 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
stay away from the q 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
but i dont like it 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
what a disappointment 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
con spotty service 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
a good time 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the food was terrible 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
great audio 1 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1
