clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
why was this film made 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
is pretty funny 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
the film is way too long 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great price also 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
has been working great 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
very disappointing 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
i paid too much 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
appetite instantly gone 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
will be back again 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
this game rocks 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
owners are really great people 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
very poor service 0 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
overall a delight 1 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
worthless product 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
doesnt last long 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
yes its that bad 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
five star plus plus 1 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
good prices 1 
dont waste your money 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
very easy to use 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
poor quality 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
poor voice clarity 0 
and it was boring 0 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
piece of trash 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
crust is not good 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
this place is good 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
very prompt service 1 
very disappointing 0 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
will definitely be back 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i liked it 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
never got it 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
great product and price 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
i thought it was bad 0 
unreliable im giving up 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
worthless product 0 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
works great 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
go and see it 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
fantastic service here 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
did not like at all 0 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
i think not again 0 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
good case excellent value 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
again no plot at all 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
love this product 1 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
everything was gross 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
i paid too much 0 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
food arrived quickly 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
absolutely great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
dont do it 0 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
we loved the place 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
omit watching this 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the only downside is the service 0 
very disappointing 0 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
service was fantastic 1 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
this game rocks 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
awful service 0 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
definitely will come back here again 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
good works fine 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
poor reliability 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
terrible management 0 
dont waste your time here 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
razr battery good buy 1 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
it was horrendous 0 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
great audio 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
very good phone 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
a bit predictable 0 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
will definitely be back 1 
total waste of time 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
camerawork again bad 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
really bad 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it works 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
and i just love the colors 1 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
a pretty good product 1 
amazon sucks 0 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
very good lunch spot 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
warning stay away 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
absolutel junk 0 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
i want my money back 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
better than new 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
used and dirty 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it looks very nice 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
i am very happy 1 
this movie is bad 0 
disappointed with battery 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
awesome device 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
i will not return 0 
highly recommended a 1 
just what i wanted 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
good prices 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
very prompt service 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
this is infuriating 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
extremely tasty 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
great for ipods too 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
nice leather 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
great phone 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
works great 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
this movie is terrible 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
i was mortified 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
either way it sucks 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
really bad 0 
the poor actors 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great choice 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
it has kept up very well 1 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
great choice 1 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
i love this thing 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i will be back many times soon 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
its pretty easy 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
this one works and was priced right 1 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it works 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
not recommended 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it was pretty gross 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
we are sending it back 0 
and it was boring 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great earpiece 1 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
the battery works great 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
wow what a bad film 0 
is pretty funny 1 
poor construction 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
will definitely be back 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
excellent 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
brilliant 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
we wont be going back 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
defective crap 0 
great phone 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
poor talk time performance 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
worked great 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
used and dirty 0 
how stupid is that 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
very very fun chef 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
disappointed 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
it was so cool 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
terrible management 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
everything stinks 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
but its just not funny 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
great phone 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
he was terrible 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
worthless product 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
very good though 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
will not be back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
awful service 0 
this place is great 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
i was so insulted 0 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
really bad 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
everything was gross 0 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
dont do it 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
battery has no life 0 
would recommend this item 1 
worst customer service 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
not good for the money 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
i wont be back 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
better than new 1 
great phone 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
very disappointing 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
disappointed 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
her role was played well 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
awful 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
they were excellent 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
the block was amazing 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
omelets are to die for 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
give this one a look 1 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
its very slow 0 
we wont be returning 0 
the block was amazing 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
great sound and service 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
they are so cool 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
very easy to use 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
excellent 1 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
painful on the ear 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
soggy and not good 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
over rated 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
really awful 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
very good though 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
great product 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
good audio quality 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this place has it 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
dont buy this product 0 
they were excellent 1 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
five star plus plus 1 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
it is shameful 0 
what a waste 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
piece of trash 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
better than youd expect 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1
