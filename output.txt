great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 

spend your money and time some place else 0 

overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 

great for the jawbone 1 

tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 

the mic is great 1 

very good quality though 1 

works great 1 

ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 

people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 

this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 

car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 

this case seems well made 1 

not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 

a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 

i love this thing 1 

i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 

these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 

great for ipods too 1 

made very sturdy 1 

im very disappointed with my decision 0 

buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 

its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 

absolutely great 1 

great audio 1 

the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 

in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 

i was not happy with this item 0 

what a waste of time 0 

i was hoping for more 0 

audio quality is poor very poor 0 

one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 

incredible 1 

great phone 1 

waste of 13 bucks 0 

the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 

the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 

good transmit audio 1 

i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 

if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 

freezes frequently4 0 

its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 

i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 

what a big waste of time 0 

dont waste your on this one 0 

worth every penny 1 

nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 

only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 

absolutel junk 0 

that one didnt work either 0 

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 

works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 

this one works and was priced right 1 

sending it back 0 

someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 

good price 1 

i am also very happy with the price 1 

excellent starter wireless headset 0 

it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 

poor sound quality 0 

better than youd expect 1 

great product and price 1 

excellent product for the price 1 

an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 

also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 

overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 

warning stay away 0 

if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 

they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 

the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 

not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 

we would recommend these to others 1 

the battery works great 1 

very disappointed in accessoryone 0 

uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 

then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 

the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 

as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 

the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 

i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 

great case and price 1 

bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 

small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 

no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 

i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 

i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 

ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 

that company is a joke 0 

better than expected 1 

it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 

piece of trash 0 

those phones are working just fine now 1 

sprint charges for this service 0 

do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 

dont bother go to the store 0 

not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 

it felt too light and tinny 0 

its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 

much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 

bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 

camera color balance is awful 0 

chinese forgeries abound 0 

i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 

it doesnt make you look cool 0 

so just beware 0 

it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 

blue ant is easy to use 1 

then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 

the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 

at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 

2 thumbs up to this seller 1 

i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 

i would recommend it 1 

that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 

its not what it says it is 0 

these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 

works fine 1 

this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 

excellent dualpurpose headset 1 

warning do not buy 0 

everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 

terrible phone holder 0 

while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 

motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 

as i said abovepretty useless 0 

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 

it is a joy to use 1 

i cannot make calls at certain places 0 

it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 

not enough volume 0 

you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 

dont waste your money 0 

adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 

there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 

the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 

lasted one day and then blew up 0 

what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 

the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 

a bit predictable 0 

there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 

waste your money on this game 1 

this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 

its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 

all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 

there are some generally great things in it 1 

i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 

the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 

definitely worth checking out 1 

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 

ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 

frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 

very disappointing 0 

the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 

and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 

the music in the film is really nice too 1 

brilliant 1 

i liked this movie way too much 1 

all in all a great disappointment 0 

the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 

i paid too much 0 

worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 

i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 

the kids are annoying 0 

utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 

nothing at all to recommend 0 

youll love it 1 

i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 

jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 

woa talk about awful 0 

the poor actors 0 

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 

i came out of it feeling angry 0 

spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 

the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 

it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 

everything about this film is simply incredible 1 

black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 

the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 

i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 

it was forced like everything in this movie 0 

and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 

summary the witticisms werent witty 0 

the plot well i said id let that one go 0 

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 

i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 

for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 

by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 

i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 

i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 

i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 

the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 

there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 

after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 

though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 

almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 

nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 

its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 

not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 

i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 

even worse than ticker 0 

an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 

i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 

and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 

this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 

totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 

but this movie really got to me 1 

the cast is good 1 

it is zillion times away from reality 0 

but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 

however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 

john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 

so badwellits just bad 0 

both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 

the lighting is awful 0 

which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 

the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 

its just painful 0 

an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 

a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 

regardless the film fails on most levels 0 

i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 

his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 

its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 

unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 

then the film just dropped the ball 0 

all of the main players are mesmerising 1 

tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 

go and see it 1 

its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 

well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 

the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 

every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 

the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 

the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 

the transfers are very good 1 

the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 

a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 

im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 

meredith m was better than all right 1 

a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 

it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 

why was this film made 0 

this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 

predictable but not a bad watch 1 

constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 

it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 

how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 

great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 

the acting is beyond abysmal 0 

also the story and acting were weak 0 

its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 

i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 

excellent short film 1 

i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 

ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 

bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 

really awful 0 

i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 

for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 

the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 

its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 

it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 

but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 

the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 

each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 

enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 

then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 

i never walked out of a movie faster 0 

all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 

the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 

the shrimp tender and moist 1 

their chow mein is so good 1 

the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 

there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 

the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 

its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 

on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 

this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 

good prices 1 

although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 

bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 

i wouldnt return 0 

definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 

penne vodka excellent 1 

dont do it 0 

and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 

the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 

this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 

some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 

i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 

the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 

not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 

i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 

great brunch spot 1 

service is friendly and inviting 1 

extremely tasty 1 

the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 

hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 

this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 

everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 

there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 

they know how to make them here 1 

plus its only 8 bucks 1 

just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 

i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 

i waited and waited 0 

i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 

never again will i be dining at this place 0 

the only downside is the service 0 

i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 

the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 

the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 

he was terrible 0 

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 

definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 

my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 

rude inconsiderate management 0 

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 

the food was terrible 0 

will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 

i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 

service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 

come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 

i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 

what a mistake that was 0 

service is quick and friendly 1 

i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 

will not be back 0 

sauce was tasteless 0 

my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 

dont waste your time here 0 

third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 

the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 

the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 

worst martini ever 0 

just spicy enough perfect actually 1 

my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 

boy was that sucker dry 0 

if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 

all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 

the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 

pretty awesome place 1 

ambience is perfect 1 

i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 

im not eating here 0 

this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 

the fried rice was dry as well 0 

the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 

the staff was very attentive 1 

and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 

as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 

service was slow and not attentive 0 

i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 

dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 

will definitely be back 1 

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 

i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 

2 thumbs up 1 

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 

special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 

never had anything to complain about here 1 

the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 

i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 

mediocre food 0 

the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 

the service was terrible though 0 

no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 

to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 

some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 

worst thai ever 0 

the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 

this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 

the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 

the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 

con spotty service 0 

the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 

after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 

the ambiance isnt much better 0 

unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 

it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0
