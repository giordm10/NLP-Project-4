i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
very friendly staff 1 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
these are the nicest restaurant owners ive ever come across 1 
jabra ear gels r the best 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
would not reccommend 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the best phone in market 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
their chow mein is so good 1 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
made very sturdy 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
the acting helps the writing along very well maybe the idiotsavant sister could have been played better and it is a real joy to watch 1 
this is a simple little phone to use but the breakage is unacceptible 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
i will never forget it now 1 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
good value great food great service 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
so far so good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
we had so much to say about the place before we walked in that he expected it to be amazing but was quickly disappointed 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
good price 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
its pretty easy 1 
very disappointed 0 
1010 1 
the story which was told so eloquently by francis ford coppola 25 years earlier really unfolds gradually and leaves room for the characters to develop 1 
terrible my car will not accept this cassette 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
the phone loads super 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
great food and awesome service 1 
the use of slowmotion needlessly repeats itself throughout the movie but is well backed up by bad acting and bad is a kind word here no continuity scenes that are thrown in for no reason whatsoever vehicles that looked like they were made from a corn flakes box and a directorial style that bordered on stupidity 0 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
my brother in law who works at the mall ate here same day and guess what he was sick all night too 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
does everything it should and more 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
service is quick and friendly 1 
the reception is excellent 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
the nano stated itmy son was dissapointed 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
omit watching this 0 
excellent short film 1 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
defective crap 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
1010 1 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
it was so cool 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
this is a great little item 1 
warning stay away 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
does not fit 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
echo problemvery unsatisfactory 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
i checked out this place a couple years ago and was not impressed 0 
we made the drive all the way from north scottsdale and i was not one bit disappointed 1 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
there are so many problems i dont know where to start 0 
this place is great 1 
im returning them 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
waitress was good though 1 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
both do good jobs and are quite amusing 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
its this pandering to the audience that sabotages most of his films 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
not impressed 0 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
if there was ever an indication of a writer and a directors ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity then this is it 1 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
very poor service 0 
was not happy 0 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the block was amazing 1 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
worthwhile 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
also the area where my unit broke im not too fond of the magnetic strap 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
these products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet 0 
and i really did find them funny 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
very comfortable 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
the food was terrible 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
if this premise sound stupid thats because it is 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
it was not good 0 
i will not return 0 
nargile i think you are great 1 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
this review is long overdue since i consider a tale of two sisters to be the single greatest film ever made 1 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
still waiting im sure this item would work well if i ever recieve it 0 
shes poised and amazing 1 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
give this one a look 1 
i especially liked the noncliche choices with the parents in other movies i could predict the dialog verbatim but the writing in this movie made better selections 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
good service very clean and inexpensive to boot 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
as for the service i thought it was good 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the design is very good4 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
only had this a month but its worked flawlessly so far 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
no real improvement 0 
but it picked up speed and got right to the point 1 
pretty piece of junk 0 
im probably one of the few people to ever go to ians and not like it 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
appears to actually outperform the original battery from china that came with my v325i 1 
improper description i had to return it 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
cant store anything but phone numbers to sim 0 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
it was a waste of my money 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
the problem was the script 0 
the plot simply rumbles on like a machine desperately depending on the addition of new scenes 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
i dont each much pasta but i love the homemade hand made pastas and thin pizzas here 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
good food good service 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
thats how id describe this painfully dreary timewaster of a film 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
after arguing with verizon regarding the dropped calls we returned the phones after two days 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
the restaurant is very clean and has a family restaurant feel to it 1 
nothing short of magnificent photographycinematography in this film 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
i probably would not go here again 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
a very good film indeed about great and unconditional love 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
by the time the film ended i not only disliked it i despised it 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
do not purchase this phone 0 
i especially love the long battery life 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i was not happy with this item 0 
brilliant 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this one is simply a disappointment 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
mediocre food 0 
and finally after all that we get to an ending that wouldve been great had it been handled by competent people and not jerry falwell 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i really loved the story line and the poler bear was kinda cutebut if anyone has a question about fort steele just ask away 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
nothing special 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
the seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree 1 
the warm beer didnt help 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
this is some seriously good pizza and im an expertconnisseur on the topic 1 
it works 1 
insults profound deuchebaggery and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it 0 
hard to judge whether these sides were good because we were grossed out by the melted styrofoam and didnt want to eat it for fear of getting sick 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
of course the acting is blah 0 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great charger 1 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
comfort for our whole family 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
left very frustrated 0 
good case excellent value 1 
cant say enough good things about this place 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
it has all the features i want 1 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
not recommended 0 
not good for the money 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
not my thing 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
poor product 0 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
food was delicious 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
seafood was limited to boiled shrimp and crab legs but the crab legs definitely did not taste fresh 0 
what a piece of junk i lose more calls on this phone 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
the han nan chicken was also very tasty 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
soyo technology sucks 0 
waitress was a little slow in service 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
bt50 battery junk 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
see it 1 
if that bug never showed up i would have given a 4 for sure but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen 0 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
a good time 1 
a bit predictable 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
awful service 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
bad quality 0 
everything was good and tasty 1 
great case and price 1 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this place is handsdown one of the best places to eat in the phoenix metro area 1 
i rate this movie 910 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i wont be back 0 
gotta love those closeups of slimy drooling teeth 1 
never got it 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
of course the footage from the 70s was grainy but that only enhanced the film 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the potato chip order was sad i could probably count how many chips were in that box and it was probably around 12 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
very easy to use 1 
poor construction 0 
the sides are delish mixed mushrooms yukon gold puree white corn beateous 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the ambiance was incredible 1 
for those that havent seen it dont waste your time 0 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver 0 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
excellent sound quality 1 
avoid this establishment 0 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
dont waste your money 0 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
paolo sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it is an insane game 1 
over rated 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
what happened next was prettyoff putting 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
good audio quality 1 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
and those baby owls were adorable 1 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
very funny 1 
service stinks here 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
its a total package 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
i consider this theft 0 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
on three different occasions i asked for well done or medium well and all three times i got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the camera although rated at an impressive 13 megapixels renders images that fall well below expectations of such a relatively high resolution 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on and i think people will be surprised by who does and doesnt make it 1 
well im satisfied 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
will order from them again 1 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
the only thing that i think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
the construction of the headsets is poor 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
low quality 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
waste of money 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i hope this place sticks around 1 
the structure of this film is easily the most tightly constructed in the history of cinema 1 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
if you plan to use this in a car forget about it 0 
its a fresh subtle and rather sublime effect 1 
dont buy this product 0 
total brunch fail 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
sooooo good 1 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
awesome service and food 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
not even good for camp value 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this is the first phone ive had that has been so cheaply made 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
a mature subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that keira knightley is prone to though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it 1 
razr battery good buy 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
con spotty service 0 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
worst service to boot but that is the least of their worries 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the phone takes forever to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
good case 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
what should have been a hilarious yummy christmas eve dinner to remember was the biggest fail of the entire trip for us 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
first off the reception sucks i have never had more than 2 bars ever 0 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
happy so far 1 
awful 0 
what a waste 0 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
so bad 0 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this film offers many delights and surprises 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
it was awesome 1 
works for me 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
waste your money on this game 1 
i wish i could enter negative values admins 0 
i did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
warning do not buy 0 
great service and food 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
i paid too much 0 
it has been a winner for us 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have had problems wit hit dropping signal and more 0 
the portion was huge 1 
items stated as included from the description are not included 0 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
but its just not funny 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
the cashier had no care what so ever on what i had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
too politically correct 0 
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
i will continue to come here on ladies night andddd date night highly recommend this place to anyone who is in the area 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
the camera really likes her in this movie 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
it was equally awful 0 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
clever and a real crowdpleaserthis film still ranks among mickeys best films even after 80 wonderful years 1 
great software for motorolas 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
the potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer 0 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
i purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work 0 
works as described 1 
i would recommend it 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
highly recommended 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
crisp and clear 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
it even has its sweet moments 1 
cinematography noteworthy including fine views of barcelona and its famed gaudi towers 1 
not a good item it worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player 0 
both great 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
fantastic food 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
a very very very slowmoving aimless movie about a distressed drifting young man 0 
these are fabulous 1 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
i didnt know pulled pork could be soooo delicious 1 
i was disgusted because i was pretty sure that was human hair 0 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
i waited and waited 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
good transmit audio 1 
highly unrecommended 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
five star plus plus 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
nice design and quality 1 
the movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the acting coach are fascinating 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
his performance is simply genius 1 
the food amazing 1 
the dialogue is composed of things that make little sense 0 
the sound quality for the device is unacceptableunless you are in a really quiet area you almost hear nothing 0 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
they do not care about the consumer one bit 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
this is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if i try to push the ear plug into my ear 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
never going back 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the films dialogue is natural real to life 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
definitely will come back here again 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
regrettably the film fails 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the chains which im no fan of beat this place easily 0 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
i want my money back 0 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
yet plantronincs continues to use the same flawed charger design 0 
the point is the journey a journey that touches every member of the family 1 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
i will come back here every time im in vegas 1 
absolutely great 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
the least said about the acting the better 0 
overall a great experience 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
this phone works great 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i recommend igo to anyone with different brand cell phonesmp3 players in the family 1 
the owner used to work at nobu so this place is really similar for half the price 1 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
couldnt figure it out 0 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
this phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at its very ability to be a phone 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
does not work 0 
this is a great phone 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
were jerks on the phone 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
great phone 1 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
maybe its just their vegetarian fare but ive been twice and i thought it was average at best 0 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
tom wilkinson broke my heart at the end and everyone elses judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike 1 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
however i recently watched the whole thing again on dvd and i was completely struck by how extremely stupid the storyline was how it contained holes inconsistencies and frankly a whole lot of crap and how horrid the dancing was 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
the phone crashed completely and now i have to get it replaced 0 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
do not waste your money here 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the result is a powerhouse achievement made more timely now perhaps because of our cultures disturbing fascination with celebrity and its distorted interpretations of fame 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
perhaps i caught them on an off night judging by the other reviews but im not inspired to go back 0 
the eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity 1 
doesnt hold charge 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i really like this product over the motorola because it is allot clearer on the ear piece and the mic 1 
dont waste your time here 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
great value 1 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
dont buy this product it fails 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
this movie has a cutting edge to it 1 
the pizza tasted old super chewy in not a good way 0 
the ripped banana was not only ripped but petrified and tasteless 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
best tacos in town by far 1 
the film is way too long 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
amazon sucks 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
so i am here to warn youdo not rent this movie it is the dumbest thing you have never seen 0 
i was seated immediately 1 
product is exactly as described 1 
service is quick and even to go orders are just like we like it 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but i dont like it 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
incredible 1 
will not be back 0 
excellent 1 
works well 1 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
the movie lacks visual interest drama expression of feeling and celebration of the very patriotism that underlines the narrative 0 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this is a good joint 1 
this movie does an excellent job of revealing the complexity of the task and the incredible challenges facing south africa 1 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
would not go back 0 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
having trouble with volume 0 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
im not sure what he was trying to do with this film 0 
does not fit 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
also the fries are without a doubt the worst fries ive ever had 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
so they performed 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
10 out of 10 for both the movie and trilogy 1 
gets the job done 1 
i believe that pitch black was done well 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
an interesting premise and billy drago is always good as a dangerous nutbag side note id love to see drago stephen mchattie and lance hendrikson in a flick together talk about raging cheekbones 1 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
the cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
great place to relax and have an awesome burger and beer 1 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
very prompt service 1 
i love being able to use one headset for both by landline and cell 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i think not again 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
woa talk about awful 0 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
good quality 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
the movie seemed a little slow at first 0 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
new battery works great in phone 1 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
and the sound quality is great 1 
this place lacked style 0 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
conclusion very filling meals 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
i wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
it was so funny 1 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the fries were great too 1 
bad purchase 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
it was so boring 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
battery life is real good 1 
go watch it 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
as for the killer dont expect anything original or even remotely frightening 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
this place was such a nice surprise 1 
cooked to perfection and the service was impeccable 1 
just what i wanted 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
brilliance indeed 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
but when i check voice mail at night the keypad backlight turns off a few seconds into the first message and then im lost 0 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
hes a national treasure 1 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
we have gotten a lot of compliments on it 1 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
this was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic 0 
my first visit to hiro was a delight 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the story is also both funny and poignant at times 1 
the buffet at bellagio was far from what i anticipated 0 
i was mortified 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
an amazing finale to possibly the best trilogy of all time 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it was delicious 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
from what my dinner companions told meeverything was very fresh with nice texture and taste 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
i love this cable it allows me to connect any miniusb device to my pc 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
nothing new there 0 
i liked it 1 
and it was boring 0 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
doesnt work 0 
its just lame 0 
worst martini ever 0 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
the biggest complaint i have is the battery drains superfast 0 
i never come again 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
the acting was decidely wooden though no worse than a period universal b movie 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
the worst experience ever 0 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
each day of the week they have a different deal and its all so delicious 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
this place is not worth your time let alone vegas 0 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
att is not clear sound is very distorted and you have to yell when you talk 0 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
not what i wanted 0 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
the plug did not work very well 0 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
very disappointing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
portable and it works 1 
call me a nut but i think this is one of the best movies ever 1 
great phone 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
has been working great 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the 12 mega pixel camera being a part of a phone is reasonably good7 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
will be back again 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
great for ipods too 1 
generally it just lacked imagination 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have had tmobile service for 2 or 3 years now and i am pretty happy with it 1 
the file browser offers all the options that one needshandsfree is great 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
will definitely be back 1 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
id like to return it 0 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the worst one of the series 0 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
great place to eat reminds me of the little mom and pop shops in the san francisco bay area 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
there still are good actors around 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
that was funny 1 
very good lunch spot 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
much better than the other ayce sushi place i went to in vegas 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
it ranks highly as a great noircrimedrama incredible performances by belmondo and lino ventura 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
i dont know what the big deal is about this place but i wont be back yaall 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i can assure you that you wont be disappointed 1 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
absolutel junk 0 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
reasonably priced also 1 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
not good enough for the price 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0 
sucked most of the stuff does not work with my phone 0 
owners are really great people 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing and here they come in thick and fast 0 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
steamboat willie is an amazingly important film to our cinema history 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the seller is very understanding and patient i would definitely buy from them again 1 
if you see it you should probably just leave it on the shelf 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
as many people complained i found this headsets microphone was very weak 0 
as for the mains also uninspired 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
no ear loop needed its tiny and the sound is great 1 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
not much seafood and like 5 strings of pasta at the bottom 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
i never walked out of a movie faster 0 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
once your food arrives its meh 0 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
hell no will i go back 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
its a feelgood film and thats how i felt when i came out of the cinema 1 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
my order was not correct 0 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
say bye bye to your tip lady 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
the decor is nice and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant 1 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
the management is rude 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
not recommended 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the service was meh 0 
great phone 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
id love to go back 1 
dont go here 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
i will be back many times soon 1 
well just if you keep thinking how bad it is 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
its kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly its embarrassing how childlike the company is 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
dont waste your time watching this rubbish nonresearched film 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
heres where the movie really pied me off 0 
an hour and a half i wish i could bring back 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
not easy to watch 0 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
reception is terrible and full of static 0 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
this is a great deal 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
nice leather 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
what a mistake 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
works great 1 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
awsome device works great 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
also notable is john baileys fine crisp beautifully colored cinematography and the great production design costumes by eiko ishioka who went on to do the memorable costumes for coppolas dracula for which she received a well deserved oscar 1 
waaaaaayyyyyyyyyy over rated is all i am saying 0 
the ambiance isnt much better 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
the food wasnt good 0 
it is perfect for a sitdown family meal or get together with a few friends 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i would avoid this place if you are staying in the mirage 0 
what makes this story different are the terrific production values faultless photography composition and editing the terrific casting the underappreciated brian keith playing a bully teddy and vivid history 1 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
worst thai ever 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
nice ambiance 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
his acting alongside olivia de havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic 1 
definitely worth venturing off the strip for the pork belly will return next time im in vegas 1 
very displeased 0 
his losing his marbles so early in the proceedings is totally implausible and unconvincing 0 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
that was done in the second movie 0 
i really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie 0 
cumbersome design 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
it has northern humour and positive about the community it represents 1 
better than expected 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
the acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
food was really boring 0 
it didnt work people can not hear me when i talk 0 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
this is a disgrace 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
they are so cool 1 
i came over from verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones the first thing i noticed was the really bad service 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
i give wirefly 1 stari will contact cingularatt and inform them of this practice 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
i hate movies like that 0 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
yes its that bad 0 
i wont be back 0 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the folks at otto always make us feel so welcome and special 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
this is an excellent film 1 
great earpiece 1 
service is also cute 1 
then as if i hadnt wasted enough of my life there they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was a great phone 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
my only problem is i thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent michael ironside 0 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the mic is great 1 
krussel always good 1 
battery has no life 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
but other than that the movie seemed to drag and the heroes didnt really work for their freedom 0 
his costars dont fare much better with people like morgan freeman jonah hill and ed helms just wasted 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
the earpiece on this is too large or too heavyit keeps falling out of my ear 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
the first thing that happened was that the tracking was off 0 
interesting decor 1 
the plastic breaks really easy on this clip 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
there is no real plot 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it wasnt busy either also the building was freezing cold 0 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
by this time our side of the restaurant was almost empty so there was no excuse 0 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
doesnt last long 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
its reception is very very poor 0 
overall i wasnt very impressed with noca 0 
poor reliability 0 
highly recommended a 1 
i enjoyed it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
after the first charge kept going dead after 12 minutes 0 
this is high adventure at its best 1 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
terrible service 0 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
meredith m was better than all right 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
this greedy corporation will never see another dime from me 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
just does not work 0 
its a great item 1 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i bought this battery with a coupon from amazon and im very happy with my purchase 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
a truly truly bad film 0 
some may say this buffet is pricey but i think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
its a great tool for entertainment communication and data managementoh be sure to use activesync 42 for optimal data synchronization results 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
worst customer service 0 
love this headset 1 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
and the rest of it just sits there being awful with soldiers singing songs about the masculinity they pledge themselves to hairsplitting about purity the admiration of swords etc 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
ive had no trouble accessing the internet downloading ringtones or performing any of the functions 1 
a greasy unhealthy meal 0 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
both of the egg rolls were fantastic 1 
dont do it 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
it plays louder than any other speaker of this size the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking however its not 1 
i love this thing 1 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
at first i thought i was grtting a good deal at 744 until i plugged it into my phone v3c razr 0 
excellent product 1 
i keep watching it over and over 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
good product good seller 1 
the lines the cuts the audio everything is wrong 0 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
painful on the ear 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
fantastic service here 1 
fast service 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
good servicecheck 1 
judith light is one of my favorite actresses and i think she does a superb job in this film 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the performances are real and gripping the crocdodile is extremely well done indeed if the black water website is to be believed thats because they used real crocs and the swamp location is fabulous 1 
the headset fulfills my requirements so i am happy with my purchase 1 
the movie is full of wonderful dancing hence the title 1 
however paul schrader has indeed made a film about mishima that is both superb complex 1 
the chips that came out were dripping with grease and mostly not edible 0 
it was so bad i had lost the heart to finish it 0 
great food 1 
very bad experience 0 
good show samsung 1 
very happy with this product 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
lovely little thriller from hitchcock with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy a kidnapped child a nasty church a foreign plot and some random taxidermists 1 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
it was horrendous 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
love this product 1 
personally i think it shows that people should learn to find a compromise them self without involving other people into issue 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
it just blew 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
oh and i forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
they work about 2 weeks then break 0 
crust is not good 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
muddy low quality sound and the casing around the wires insert was poorly super glued and slid off 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
youll love it 1 
hated it 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
last time buying from you 0 
great brunch spot 1 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
really good product 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
works fine 1 
then theres the plot holes 0 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
if you love death and decay and shakespears lyrics this is the one 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
if she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed not sure if we will go back and try it again 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
we loved the place 1 
a great touch 1 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its very slow 0 
we recently witnessed her poor quality of management towards other guests as well 0 
item does not match picture 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
eclectic selection 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
buyerbe very careful 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
the cast was great 1 
great price too 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
the dialogue sucked 0 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
the bipolarity of the ruthless thug one minute a ruthless killer the next minute a luvs diaper commercial is completely unconvincing 0 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
great pork sandwich 1 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
that company is a joke 0 
this product is great it makes working a lot easier i can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something 1 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
perfect for the ps3 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it was horrible 0 
battery life is also great 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
highquality chicken on the chicken caesar salad 1 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
works great 1 
the movie is terribly boring in places 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
this place is good 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
its just painful 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
good works fine 1 
totally believable 1 
horrible horrible protector 0 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
the kids are annoying 0 
for service i give them no stars 0 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
disappointing experience 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery 0 
lasted one day and then blew up 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the movie is not completely perfect but titta di girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
their daily specials are always a hit with my group 1 
love it great armband 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
im pleased 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they have a really nice atmosphere 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
after a year the battery went completely dead on my headset 0 
performed awful muffled tinny incoming sound and severe echo for those on the other end of the call 0 
it crackles with an unpredictable youthful energy but honestly i found it hard to follow and concentrate on it meanders so badly 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i would recommend this 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
in my house i was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement 0 
how awful she is 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
what did bother me was the slow service 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
the poor actors 0 
to my disbelief each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods i have ever tasted 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
never been to hard rock casino before will never ever step forward in it again 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
very disappointing 0 
this is infuriating 0 
what a disappointment 0 
it deserves strong love 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
phone falls out easily 0 
regardless the film fails on most levels 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
freezes frequently4 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
it is not good 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
the interplay between martin and emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in wall street with martin and charlie 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i have bought this nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
damn good steak 1 
id say that would be the hardest decision honestly all of ms dishes taste how they are supposed to taste amazing 1 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
i heart this place 1 
please dont waste your money 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
love this phone 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
feelings thoughtsgabriels discomfort during the danceall these intangibles leap to life and come within the viewers grasp in hustons portrayal 1 
these were so good we ordered them twice 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
dont waste your money 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i would highly recommend this product 1 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
poor quality and service 0 
sam shepards portrayal of a gung ho marine was sobering 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
you truly take this journey through the eyes and soul of a child 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
great phone 1 
check it out 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
my sister has one also and she loves it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
there was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
it is the best charger i have seen on the market yet 1 
great product and price 1 
they keep getting better and better this is my third one and ive had numerous palms too 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
it is worth the drive 1 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
do not waste your time 0 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
my only complaint is the standard sound volume is a little low even when turned up to 5of 5 0 
even worse than ticker 0 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
item arrived quickly and works great with my metro pcs samsung schr450 slider phone and sony premium sound in ear plugs 1 
lousy product 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
seriously its not worth wasting your or your kids time on 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
this phone might well be the worst ive ever had in any brand 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
it lasts less than 3o minutes if i actually try to use the phonemy wife has the same phone with the same problem 0 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
i cant wait to go back 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
this was like the final blow 0 
works great 1 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
the price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
it was way over fried 0 
but the convoluted plot just didnt convince me and much of the film was watched with a weird questioning glance 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
great product for the price 1 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
magical help 1 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
i immediately said i wanted to talk to the manager but i did not want to talk to the guy who was doing shots of fireball behind the bar 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
everything about this movie is stupid 0 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
will not be back 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
i bought two of them and neither will charge 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
a disappointment 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
so just beware 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
it isnt even an achievement as a sobaditsgood or sobaditsmemorable movie 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
seller shipped quickly and much cheaper than the competitors 1 
im glad the film didnt go for the most obvious choice as a lesser film certainly would have 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
best tater tots in the southwest 1 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
good product incredible value 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
how can you call yourself a steakhouse if you cant properly cook a steak i dont understand 0 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
the manager was the worst 0 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
food arrived quickly 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
what a waste of money and time 0 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
case was more or less an extra that i originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear 0 
awesome device 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
oh the charger seems to work fine 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it worked very well 1 
camera color balance is awful 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
another note about this phones appearance is that it really looks rather bland especially in the all black model 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when im not wearing it 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i know this is not like the other restaurants at all something is very off here 0 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
the characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
it fits my ear well and is comfortable on 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the acting was bad 0 
price is good too 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
horrible 0 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
dont buy it 0 
service was very prompt 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
the food is good 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
however my girl was complain that some time the phone doesnt wake up like normal phone does 0 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
you cant relate with them hell you barely can understand them 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
very very sad 0 
the attempts at humor were pitiful and story is so awful it dosent bear thinking about which basically involves a vulcan stealing the enterprise to find god seriously i just didnt care about any of this film and oh not to mention uhura does a belly dance to distract male guards 0 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
i guess i should have known that this place would suck because it is inside of the excalibur but i didnt use my common sense 0 
the only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
dont waste your time 0 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
plus its only 8 bucks 1 
everything is appalling 0 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
everyone is very attentive providing excellent customer service 1 
he was terrible 0 
disappointing accessory from a good manufacturer 0 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
the owners really really need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
a fantastic neighborhood gem 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
then i had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping 0 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
dont waste your money 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
exceptionally bad 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
i think i was one of the people who found this another one of roths pearls 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
its a sad movie but very good 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
i have 23 bars on my cell phone when i am home but you cant not hear anything 0 
after 3 months screen just went black all of a sudden 0 
delicious and i will absolutely be back 1 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
worked perfectly 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
horrible phone 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
this item worked great but it broke after 6 months of use 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i love this device 1 
from here on the widmark character turns unintentionally comical 0 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it really created a unique feeling though 1 
i was very disappointed in the movie 0 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
up there with the best of melville 1 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
piece of trash 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
worst ever 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i mean really how do you get so famous for your fish and chips when its so terrible 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
again no plot at all 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
i love this bluetooth 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
the steak and the shrimp are in my opinion the best entrees at gc 1 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the instructions didnt explain that a microphone jack could be used 0 
the script is bad very bad  it contains both cheesiness and unethical joke that you normally see in rated r or nc17 movie 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
things happen characters personalities change plot twists occur for no real reason other than that script calls for it 0 
this movie is a good and humorous comment on life in 2006 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
great choice 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
see both films if you can 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
if good intentions made a film great then this film might be one of the greatest films ever made 1 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
did not like at all 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
i highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
they were excellent 1 
i would recommend saving room for this 1 
a standout scene 1 
great hands free device 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
disappointed 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
i can take a little bad service but the food sucks 0 
not sure who was more lost the flat characters or the audience nearly half of whom walked out 0 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this movie is excellentangel is beautiful and scamp is adorablehis little yelps when hes scaredand the funniest parts are whenscamp is caught under the curtain and when angel and scamp are singing ive never had this feeling beforei totally recommend this movieits coming out on special edition on june 20the cover has scamp on a garbage can and angel underneath the lid 1 
avoid this one if you can 0 
delicious 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
here in the wind and the lion we see a wonderful rendering of americas own imperial age 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
this game rocks 1 
another thing i didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
i have yet to run this new battery below two bars and thats three days without charging 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it will drive you barking mad 0 
dont buy this product 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
i dont think ill be running back to carlys anytime soon for food 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i have tried these cables with my computer and my ipod and it works just fine 1 
car charger as well as ac charger are included to make sure you never run out of juicehighy recommended 1 
the cast is good 1 
used and dirty 0 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
the last 15 minutes of movie are also not bad as well 1 
i have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful 1 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the range is very decent ive been able to roam around my house with the phone in the living room with no receptionsound quality issues 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
how can that bethe audio quality is poor 0 
very disappointing 0 
my boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
very good phone 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
works good 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
recommend with confidence 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
overall a delight 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
worthless product 0 
very unreliable service from tmobile 0 
excellent hands free tool 1 
the memories are murky but i can only say that i enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show 1 
this phone is very fast with sending any kind of messages and web browsing is significantly faster than previous phones i have used 1 
superb phone on a great network 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
appetite instantly gone 0 
total waste of time 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
50 down the drain 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
kind of flops around 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
this scene is very strong and unpleasant 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
the only downside is the service 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
great pocket pc phone combination 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
2 thumbs up 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it really is impressive that the place hasnt closed down 0 
customer service was terrible 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
is pretty funny 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
i love this place 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
i love this place 1 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
babie bop is very cute 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
simply beautiful 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film 1 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
so anyone near you will hear part of your conversation 0 
you share general loewenhielms exquisite joy in his partaking of the cailles en sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie but you do wish for just a small sample to savor 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
this place has it 1 
i saw this short film on hbo the other day and absolutely loved it 1 
i could care less the interior is just beautiful 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
the story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
this is cool because most cases are just open there allowing the screen to get all scratched up 1 
poor sound quality 0 
very very fun chef 1 
we wont be going back 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
service was excellent and prices are pretty reasonable considering this is vegas and located inside the crystals shopping mall by aria 1 
the service here is fair at best 0 
very satisifed with that 1 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
everything was gross 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
if you are looking for a good quality motorola headset keep looking this isnt it 0 
food was so gooodd 1 
a happy wonderful feel good ending 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
bad reception 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
why was this film made 0 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
waiter was a jerk 0 
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
they have great dinners 1 
it looks very nice 1 
worked great 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
it was just too horrible 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
it is shameful 0 
john garfield ann revere lilli plmer william conrad canada leeand filmed by one of the greatest cinematographers to ever grace the screenjames wong howe 1 
excellent performance 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i was so insulted 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
all the bread is made inhouse 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
today the graphics are crap 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
design flaw 0 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
battery is terrible 0 
i am very happy 1 
great movie 1 
piece of junk 0 
there is really nothing for me at postinos hope your experience is better 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
not worth it 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
this movie is greatespecially if you enjoy visual arts 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
dont buy it 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
ambience is perfect 1 
the burger i got the gold standard a 17 burger and was kind of disappointed 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
service sucks 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
the writer gorman bechard undoubtedly did his homework because all references are industry and characterage appropriate 1 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one line to another or fit the surroundings 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
not only did it only confirm that the film would be unfunny and generic but it also managed to give away the entire movie and im not exaggerating every moment every plot point every joke is told in the trailer 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the only consistent thread holding the series together were the amazing performances of leni parker and anita laselva as the two taelons in quiet idealogical conflict 0 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
poor quality 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
the battery is completely useless to me 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
the food was very good 1 
food was average at best 0 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
the fried rice was dry as well 0 
as for the service im a fan because its quick and youre being served by some nice folks 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
well never go again 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
very disappointed 0 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
this place is pretty good nice little vibe in the restaurant 1 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
its really easy 1 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i highly recommend this case 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
this phone is slim and light and the display is beautiful 1 
blue ant is easy to use 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
i wear glasses and it fits fine with them 1 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great price also 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
its the best headset i have used 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
i did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but i learned the lesson that i should not have bought this form online anyway 0 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
we wont be returning 0 
i love it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
classywarm atmosphere fun and fresh appetizers succulent steaks baseball steak 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
extremely tasty 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i dont know exactly what it is about this movie but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our familys memories 1 
disappointing 0 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
sending it back 0 
this case seems well made 1 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
you cant beat that 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
best headset ever 1 
good item low price 1 
works great 1 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
terrible management 0 
lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad 0 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
it was probably dirt 0 
go and see it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
go rent it 1 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
im not eating here 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
this pair of headphones is the worst that i have ever had soundwise 0 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
if you do go see this movie bring a pillow or a girlfriendboyfriend to keep you occupied through out 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
great food and great service in a clean and friendly setting 1 
it was pretty gross 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i really liked that 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
great audio 1 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
i seriously cannot believe that the owner has so many unexperienced employees that all are running around like chickens with their heads cut off 0 
one of the best mexican movies ever and one of the less understood even by mexican themselves no matter how identified the should have felt with it 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
level 5 spicy was perfect where spice didnt overwhelm the soup 1 
highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the chefs were friendly and did a good job 1 
this one works and was priced right 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
saw the movie today and thought it was a good effort good messages for kids 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
sounds good reasonably priced and effective its that simple 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
i swung in to give them a try but was deeply disappointed 0 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
im super pissd 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
truly awful 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
you wont regret it 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
it is an hour and half waste of time following a bunch of very pretty high schoolers whine and cry about life 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the vegetables are so fresh and the sauce feels like authentic thai 1 
i loved it 1 
then the film just dropped the ball 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
what a waste of time 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
really bad 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the mic there is a joke and the volume is quite low 0 
its one of the movies i need to see whenever it comes on tvnever mind the fact that i already have it memorized 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
i probably wont be coming back here 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
i had a pretty satifying experience 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
i just saw this film and i recommend it 1 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
ill put this gem up against any movie in terms of screenplay cinematography acting postproduction editing directing or any other aspect of filmmaking 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
her role was played well 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1
