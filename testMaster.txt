what a waste of money and time 0 
very good quality though 1 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
very disappointed 0 
you have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly 0 
mic doesnt work 0 
for a product that costs as much as this one does i expect it to work far better and with greater ease than this thing does 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
absolutely great 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the accompanied software is almost brilliant 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
youll love how thin it is 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
great sound and service 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
worth every penny 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
poor quality and service 0 
works great 1 
love this headset 1 
unreliable im giving up 0 
reversible plug works great 1 
piece of junk 0 
excellent phone 1 
the voice recognition thru the handset is excellent 1 
customer service was terrible 0 
good price 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
bad fit way too big 0 
waste of money 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
very prompt service 1 
ill be looking for a new earpiece 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
theres really nothing bad i can say about this headset 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the delivery was on time 1 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
plug was the wrong size 0 
i would have given no star if i was able 0 
greatno problems at all 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the sound is clear and the people i talk to on it are amazed at the quality too 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
that company is a joke 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
also difficult to put onid recommend avoiding this product 0 
they are so cool 1 
a pretty good product 1 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
this is infuriating 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
very windresistant 1 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
this product is clearly not ready for prime time i dont care how cool it looks if you cant tell a call is coming in its worthless 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
this case has passed the one year mark and while it shows signs of wear it is 100 functional 1 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
disappointing 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
would not reccommend 0 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
but now that it is out of warranty the same problems reoccurebottom line put your money somewhere else cingular will not support it 0 
it was horrible 0 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
i own 2 of these cases and would order another 1 
five star plus plus 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
that being said for a phone the camera is very nice many cool effects to play with and video is decent as well 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
just does not work 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
good quality 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
everything about this product is wrongfirst 0 
terrible phone holder 0 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
nice leather 1 
very satisifed with that 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
you also cannot take pictures with it in the case because the lense is covered 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
totally believable 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
very disappointing 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
i cannot believe that the actors agreed to do this film 0 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
these are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly stereotypically and with no depth of imagination 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
your brain will attempt to shutdown as part of a primal impulse of selfpreservation 0 
nothing at all to recommend 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
this movie is bad 0 
the film is way too long 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
i was totally fascinated by the music the dancing everything 1 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if you check the directors filmography on this site you will see why this film didnt have a chance 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
no actress has been worse used that june allison in this movie 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
yes i am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity for this really is at the core of the problems with this film it has too much going on without any real fulfilling explanation 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
if only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
at no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like america 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
see it 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
about ten minutes into this film i started having second thoughts 0 
for that its worth checking out 1 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
i dont think there are any redeeming qualities in this remake 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
i cant believe theres even a sequel to this 0 
which is precisely why i am giving it such a bad review 0 
perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
go watch it 1 
very funny 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
you wont regret it 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the movie has almost no action scenes in it and very little comedy 0 
despite the pans of reviewers i liked this movie 1 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this movie is so awesome 1 
if you want a real scare rent this one 1 
1010 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
avoid at all costs 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
this was one of the worst films i have ever seen 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
the characters are interesting even if a bit predictable 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
shes poised and amazing 1 
i was bored throughout the whole damn thing 0 
this film tries to be a serious and sophisticated thrillerhorror flick and it fails miserably 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
lange had become a great actress 1 
wow loved this place 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
there is not a deal good enough that would drag me into that establishment again 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
there is so much good food in vegas that i feel cheated for wasting an eating opportunity by going to rice and company 0 
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
interesting decor 1 
the live music on fridays totally blows 0 
wont go back 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
this is an unbelievable bargain 1 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
things that went wrong they burned the saganaki 0 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
i love this place 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
for service i give them no stars 0 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
total letdown i would much rather just go to the camelback flower shop and cartel coffee 0 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
the food is very good for your typical bar food 1 
it was a drive to get there 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
service was good and the company was better 1 
if you look for authentic thai food go else where 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
my friend did not like his bloody mary 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
food was average at best 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
eclectic selection 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
we ordered some old classics and some new dishes after going there a few times and were sorely disappointed with everything 0 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was way over fried 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
the block was amazing 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
lastly the mozzarella sticks they were the best thing we ordered 1 
the food was terrible 0 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
very poor service 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
overall a great experience 1 
we wont be returning 0 
very very sad 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
overall i was not impressed and would not go back 0
