if you are razr owneryou must have this 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
very good quality though 1 
i went on motorolas website and followed all directions but could not get it to pair again 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
poor talk time performance 0 
it has a great camera thats 2mp and the pics are nice and clear with great picture quality 1 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
disappointed with battery 0 
these headphones were a great find and i think they are perhaps the best purchase ive made in the last several years seriously 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
my headset works just peachykeen 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
w810i is just superb 1 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
excellent service 1 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
bad choice 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
we are sending it back 0 
worst phone ever 0 
all in all id expected a better consumer experience from motorola 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
great sound and service 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
worth every penny 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
great phone 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
great phone 1 
excellent phone 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
the instruction manual is lacking 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
better than youd expect 1 
very pleased with this headset 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
fantastic earphones 1 
i wish i could return the unit and get back my money 0 
they made this case too small and is very difficult to install 0 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
the battery works great 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
i love this phone 1 
its not user friendly 0 
this pda rocks 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
i got the aluminum case for my new palm vx and it worked really wellit has protected my handheld perfectly so far 1 
very good product well made 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
really ugly 0 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
so i basically threw my money out the window for nothing 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
its aggravating 0 
disapointing results 0 
great product 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
the battery life is highly unacceptable 0 
due to this happening on every call i was forced to stop using this headset 0 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
easy to use 1 
better than new 1 
a pretty good product 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i used bitpim a free program you can find on the internetto transfer data to the phonethe price of the cable was excellent 1 
very windresistant 1 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
nice sound 1 
bluetooth does not work phone locks up screens just flash up and now it just makes calls randomly while in my pocket locked 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
we have tried 2 units and they both failed within 2 months pros 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
great product 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
this is a great deal 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
if there is a wind it is completely useless 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
not as good as i had hoped 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
stay away from the q 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
how stupid is that 0 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
cool phone 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
buttons are too small 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
sweetest phone 1 
not enough volume 0 
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor 0 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
disappointed 0 
wasted two hours 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
graphics is far from the best part of the game 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
its pure brilliance 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
the scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going 1 
it was too predictable even for a chick flick 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
yeah the movie pretty much sucked 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
utterly without merit on any level this is akin to torture 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
this movie is bad 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
the flat reenactments dont hold your attention because they are emotionally adrift and stagy 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
the acting sucked 0 
that was nice 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
again lame 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
highly entertaining at all angles 1 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
so for our enjoyment we get to see them run around play games and be dangerous 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
this movie is terrible 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the new characters werent all that memorable and i found myself forgetting who was who 0 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
that movie was bad 0 
only like 3 or 4 buildings used a couple of locations maybe poor hummh 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
i know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts but the acting was as bad as the script 0 
victor mclaglen was even bad and brian donlevy was almost unrecognizable 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
i was deeply impressed with the character he played 1 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
i really hope the team behind this movie makes more movies and that they will continue to do so in their own some kinda weird style 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
one of the most disappointing aspects is the lack of notable gore 0 
the visual effects were awful 0 
he is almost unbearable to watch on screen he has little to no charisma and terrible comedic timing 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
there is no plot here to keep you going in the first place 0 
dont miss it 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
avoid at all costs 0 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
ill give this film 10 out of 10 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
speaking of the music it is unbearably predictably and kitchy 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
you wont regret it 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
you can find better movies at youtube 0 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
the foreigner is not worth one second of your time 0 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
lots of holes in the script 0 
everything stinks 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
the script is horrendously stupid 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
now this is a movie i really dislike 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
there is however some pretty good acting at least for this type of film 1 
really awful 0 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
their onscreen chemistry critical to the entire film is genuine 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
the art style has the appearance of crayonpencil drawings and is wonderfully colorful and fanciful 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
then i watched it again two sundays ago march 20th 2005 and i began to really enjoy it and this time i taped the entire thing 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
wow loved this place 1 
honeslty it didnt taste that fresh 0 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
loved itfriendly servers great food wonderful and imaginative menu 1 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
good prices 1 
kind of hard to mess up a steak but they did 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the waiter wasnt helpful or friendly and rarely checked on us 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
what i really like there is the crepe station 1 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
wont go back 0 
soggy and not good 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
very tough and very short on flavor 0 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i had the mac salad and it was pretty bland so i will not be getting that again 0 
this place is amazing 1 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
will never ever go back 0 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
when my mom and i got home she immediately got sick and she only had a few bites of salad 0 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this place deserves one star and 90 has to do with the food 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
food was really good and i got full petty fast 1 
service was fantastic 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
what a mistake that was 0 
no complaints 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
my ribeye steak was cooked perfectly and had great mesquite flavor 1 
i dont think well be going back anytime soon 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
very good though 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
i dont think i will be back for a very long time 0 
how awesome is that 1 
be sure to order dessert even if you need to pack it togo the tiramisu and cannoli are both to die for 1 
the bartender was also nice 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
my salad had a bland vinegrette on the baby greens and hearts of palm 0 
an hour seriously 0 
he also came back to check on us regularly excellent service 1 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
we got sitting fairly fast but ended up waiting 40 minutes just to place our order another 30 minutes before the food arrived 0 
i just wanted to leave 0 
an absolute must visit 1 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
the roast beef sandwich tasted really good 1 
very very disappointed ordered the 35 big bay plater 0 
the staff was very attentive 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
awesome selection of beer 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
tasted like dirt 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
when i received my pita it was huge it did have a lot of meat in it so thumbs up there 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
it was packed 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
it also took her forever to bring us the check when we asked for it 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
we started with the tuna sashimi which was brownish in color and obviously wasnt fresh 0 
food was below average 0
