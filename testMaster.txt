good case excellent value 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
very good quality though 1 
works great 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
great for ipods too 1 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it has been a winner for us 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the bt headset was such a disapoinment 0 
very good stuff for the price 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
what a waste of time 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
one thing i hate is the mode set button at the side 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
incredible 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
great price also 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i have had this phone for over a year now and i will tell you its not that great 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
good product incredible value 1 
works great 1 
its a great item 1 
dont waste your money 0 
this item is great installed it let it charged up overnite and it has been working good every since with no problems 1 
great phone 1 
sending it back 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
the ngage is still lacking in earbuds 0 
howeverthe riingtones are not the best and neither are the games 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
new battery works great in phone 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
also if your phone is dropped this case is not going to save it specially when dropped face down 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
it definitely was not as good as my s11 1 
the worst piece of crap ever along with the verizon customer service 0 
very prompt service 1 
works great 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
low quality 0 
awsome device works great 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
the screen size is big key pad lit well enough and the camera quality is excellent for a camera phone 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
looks great and is strong 1 
the volume switch rocketed out of the unit to a destination unknown 0 
i love this phone 1 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
i had to go to a store and bought a new nokia phone which is working great 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
its aggravating 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
a pretty good product 1 
this is a great phone 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
it quit working after id used it for about 18 months so i just purchased another one because this is the best headset ive ever owned 1 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
wont work right or atleast for me 0 
great phone 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
good case 1 
really good product 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
warning do not buy 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
good show samsung 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
you get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off 1 
i use this product in a motor control center where there is a lot of high voltage humming from the equipment and it works great 1 
its pretty easy 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
lousy product 0 
sweetest phone 1 
dont waste your money 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
a bit predictable 0 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
it is an insane game 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
frankly after cotton club and unfaithful it was kind of embarrassing to watch lane and gere in this film because it is bad 0 
some applause should be given to the prelude however 1 
imdb ratings only go as low 1 for awful its time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
horrible 0 
awful 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
the lead man is charismafree 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the soundtrack sucked 0 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
and his subtle connections between the three films are awesome 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
im translating movies for a living and this is the first movie in my 5year working experience that i found offensive to my intelligence 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
to those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful i can only say its your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt its in our human nature to try and make sense of things 0 
all the characters in this film are tremendously well played 1 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
babie bop is very cute 1 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
elias koteasjack palance play good roles angelina is hot and gets nakedbilly drago appears in this and is cool as usual a cameo by sven ole thorsen helps make this a very enjoyable movie with good acting and a decent budget 1 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
oh yeah and the storyline was pathetic too 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
bela lugosi was totally extraneous intoning odd lines 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
i wasnt expecting oscar material but this 0 
whatever the producer was going for he missed entirely 0 
a cheap and cheerless heist movie with poor characterisation lots of underbite style stoic emoting think chow yun fat in a better tomorrow and some cheesy clichés thrown into an abandoned factory ready for a few poorly executed flying judo rolls a la john woo 0 
lifetime does not air it enough so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a musthave 1 
i particularly remember my senses being assaulted by strident cords of music that would blare out with very little warning and even less meaning 0 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
this is probably the most irritating show i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
everything about it is just bad 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
to sum the film up breeders is a terrible cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the ebola virus 0 
aside from its terrible lead this film has loads of other debits 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
it failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
her lines seem to have been written by a fifteen year old though they are trying oh so so hard to sound like how a fifteen year old would really um you know well talk 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
go and see it 1 
punishment park is a brilliant piece of cinema 1 
delete this film from your mind 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
the movie was very interesting from beginning to the end 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
this mostly routine factbased tv drama gets a boost from the fine performance by cole 1 
she carries the movie well 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the only place good for this film is in the garbage 0 
when a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better such as when jay adams unfortunate life was a subject of talk the song old man by neil young was played which evokes many emotions 1 
cinematography the film was shot in an interesting way 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
there arent death scenes like in previous movies and the fx are terrible 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
hated it 0 
this is one of the worst sandra bullock movie since speed 2 but not quite that bad 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
bad characters bad story and bad acting 0 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
think of the film being like a dream 1 
its a gloriously fun fast paced and fairly accurate portrayal of the night of a raver 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
this one wants to surf on the small wave of space movies in 1998 deep impact and armageddon and this one fails everywhere 0 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
in a word it is embarrassing 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
highly recommended 1 
the food amazing 1 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
he came running after us when he realized my husband had left his sunglasses on the table 1 
the portion was huge 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
everything was fresh and delicious 1 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
on the up side their cafe serves really good food 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
delicious 1 
so dont go there if you are looking for good food 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
this wonderful experience made this place a muststop whenever we are in town again 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
the descriptions said yum yum sauce and another said eel sauce yet another said spicy mayowell none of the rolls had sauces on them 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
i have been in more than a few bars in vegas and do not ever recall being charged for tap water 0 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
for a self proclaimed coffee cafe i was wildly disappointed 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
service stinks here 0 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
the servers are not pleasant to deal with and they dont always honor pizza hut coupons 0 
i love this place 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
this place is like chipotle but better 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
i find wasting food to be despicable but this just wasnt food 0 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
to summarize the food was incredible nay transcendant but nothing brings me joy quite like the memory of the pneumatic condiment dispenser 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
our server was very nice and even though he looked a little overwhelmed with all of our needs he stayed professional and friendly until the end 1 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
food was so gooodd 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
very good though 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
we had a group of 70 when we claimed we would only have 40 and they handled us beautifully 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
i really do recommend this place you can go wrong with this donut place 1 
all of the tapas dishes were delicious 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
an absolute must visit 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
food was average at best 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
would not recommend to others 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the food was great as always compliments to the chef 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
a fly was in my apple juice a fly 0 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
will not be back 0 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i had to wait over 30 minutes to get my drink and longer to get 2 arepas 0 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
their frozen margaritas are way too sugary for my taste 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
the nachos are a must have 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
the service was terrible though 0 
i love this place 1 
it kept getting worse and worse so now im officially done 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
very poor service 0 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
worst thai ever 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we wont be going back 0 
this place lacked style 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
it was a bit too sweet not really spicy enough and lacked flavor 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0
