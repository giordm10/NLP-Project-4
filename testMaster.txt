the commercials are the most misleading 0 
people couldnt hear me talk and i had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone 0 
nice headset priced right 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this device is great in several situations1 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this phone works great 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
i received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger 0 
great product fast shipping 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
could not get strong enough signal 0 
bad quality 0 
it is so small and you dont even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it 1 
very good stuff for the price 1 
voice recognition is tremendous 1 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
its reception is very very poor 0 
i had absolutely no problem with this headset linking to my 8530 blackberry curve 1 
i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
light weight i hardly notice it is there 1 
all in all i think it was a good investment 1 
worst phone ever 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
dont waste your on this one 0 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i wasted my little money with this earpiece 0 
i am very impressed with this headset from plantronics 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
piece of junk 0 
dont buy it 0 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
i love this device 1 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
clear skype calls long battery life long range 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
works great 1 
an awesome new look for fall 2000 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
its really easy 1 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
im glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find it wasnt high priced 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
very disappointed in accessoryone 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
bad purchase 0 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
i ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead 1 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great case and price 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
i love the camera its really pretty good quality 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
its a total package 1 
i have purchased these for both family and friends and all enjoy their clarity and ease of use 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
great product 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
the real killer is the volume and of course it breaking 0 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone 0 
poor product 0 
you need two hands to operate the screenthis software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs 0 
steer clear of this product and go with the genuine palm replacementr pens which come in a threepack 0 
these are fabulous 1 
utter crap sound quality is terrible 0 
the charger arrived within the promised timeframe but it did not work 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
setup went very smoothly 1 
truly awful 0 
it works fine on my motorola 325 cellphone and a lot better than the wornout battery did 1 
i love the ringtones because they are so upbeat 1 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
works well 1 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
i bought this phone as a replacement for my startac and have regretted it since 0 
it was a great phone 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
bought mainly for the charger which broke soon after purchasing 0 
stay away from this store be careful 0 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
crisp and clear 1 
treo and tmobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount 0 
yes its shiny on front side and i love it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
doesnt work 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
so far it has worked like a charm 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it was quite comfortable in the ear 1 
problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
down the drain because of a weak snap 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port irda 0 
wasted two hours 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
this is the kind of money that is wasted properly 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
but whatever it was that cost them so much it didnt translate to quality thats for sure 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
on the negative its insipid enough to cause regret for another 2 hours of life wasted in front of the screen 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
anne heche was utterly convincing 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
one character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
he is an amazing film artist one of the most important whoever lived 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
i really liked that 1 
the music in the film is really nice too 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was so boring 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
maybe there would be a reasonable explanation for this atrocity 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
youll love it 1 
so bad 0 
in fact its hard to remember that the part of ray charles is being acted and not played by the man himself 1 
mishima is extremely uninteresting 0 
schrader has made a resume full of lousy amateurish films 0 
the worst sappiest dialogue i could go on and on 0 
bad script bad direction and horrible acting make this one plain bad 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
that was funny 1 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
black water is a thriller that manages to completely transcend its limitations its an indie flick by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
the plot well i said id let that one go 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
there is a brilliant twist ending 1 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
now you know why i gave it a 10 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
the plot was the same as pretty much every other cheap horror 0 
this totally unfunny movie is so over the top and pathetic and unrealistic that throughout the whole 90 minutes of utter torture i probably looked at my watch about 70000 times 0 
lucy bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
the sets especially designed to work with the camera are amazingstylized beautiful and effective 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
the soundtrack wasnt terrible either 1 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
it is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs 0 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the script is a big flawed mess 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
beware this is not a trashy cult movie this is trash period 0 
go watch it 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
the basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew 0 
the cast is always entertaining as usual 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
this is an excellent film 1 
its a case of so bad it is laughable 0 
delete this film from your mind 0 
avoid avoid avoid 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
i guess i liked the details of his dysfunctionhe was believable 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
the plot is nonsense that doesnt interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it 0 
this movie is so awesome 1 
as a courtroom drama its compelling as an indictment on the american justice system its frightening 1 
this film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process that its not about discovering guilt or innocence but rather is about who presents better in court 1 
how this piece of trash was ever released is beyond me the acting the story the characters the supposedly special effects etcits all wrong 0 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
dont waste your time 0 
the acting is beyond abysmal 0 
trouble is the writing and directing make it impossible to establish those things that make a movie watchable like character story theme and so on 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
what the hell kind of crap is that 0 
the acting sucks the music sucks the script sucks the pacing sucks the special fx suck the directing sucks basically this movie sucks 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
excellent short film 1 
ive seen soap operas more intelligent than this movie 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
they are so easy to love but even more easy to identify with 1 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
brilliance indeed 1 
but if you liked movies like the matrix and better yet their sequels i think youll appreciate the thought provoking mindblowing experience this film will give you 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
wow loved this place 1 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
the food amazing 1 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
great food and service huge portions and they give a military discount 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the service was meh 0 
coming here is like experiencing an underwhelming relationship where both parties cant wait for the other person to ask to break up 0 
the pan cakes everyone are raving about taste like a sugary disaster tailored to the palate of a six year old 0 
in summary this was a largely disappointing dining experience 0 
it was not good 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
check it out 1 
i wouldnt return 0 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
my fiancé and i came in the middle of the day and we were greeted and seated right away 1 
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
this really is how vegas fine dining used to be right down to the menus handed to the ladies that have no prices listed 1 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
it was probably dirt 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
wont go back 0 
the shower area is outside so you can only rinse not take a full shower unless you dont mind being nude for everyone to see 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
ive had better not only from dedicated boba tea spots but even from jenni pho 0 
i went to bachi burger on a friends recommendation and was not disappointed 1 
i hate to disagree with my fellow yelpers but my husband and i were so disappointed with this place 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the food was very good 1 
both of them were truly unbelievably good and i am so glad we went back 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it was delicious 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
today was my first taste of a buldogis gourmet hot dog and i have to tell you it was more than i ever thought possible 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
furthermore you cant even find hours of operation on the website 0 
weve tried to like this place but after 10 times i think were done with them 0 
i never come again 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the inside is really quite nice and very clean 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
this isnt a small family restaurant this is a fine dining establishment 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
terrible service 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
we waited for thirty minutes to be seated although there were 8 vacant tables and we were the only folks waiting 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i heart this place 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
an hour seriously 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
all in all i can assure you ill be back 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
itll be a regular stop on my trips to phoenix 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
i asked multiple times for the wine list and after some time of being ignored i went to the hostess and got one myself 0 
the staff is always super friendly and helpful which is especially cool when you bring two small boys and a baby 1 
im not eating here 0 
hands down my favorite italian restaurant 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
awesome service and food 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
food was good service was good prices were good 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
i dont have very many words to say about this place but it does everything pretty well 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
they were goldencrispy and delicious 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
but i definitely would not eat here again 0 
food quality has been horrible 0 
for that price i can think of a few place i would have much rather gone 0 
the service here is fair at best 0 
i wont be back 0 
i would not recommend this place 0 
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
went in for happy hour great list of wines 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
i had about two bites and refused to eat anymore 0 
the pizza selections are good 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
very very sad 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
then our food came out disappointment ensued 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0
