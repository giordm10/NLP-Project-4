i connected my wifes bluetoothmotorola hs850 to my phone and it worked like a charm whether the phone was in my pocket or the case 1 
ive had this bluetoooth headset for some time now and still not comfortable with the way it fits on the ear 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
lately they have been extremely nice and helpful on the phone 1 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
battery lasts only a few hours 0 
ive had this for nearly 2 years and it has worked great for me 1 
we are sending it back 0 
i also didnt like the on button it felt like it would crack with use 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
i love all the features and form factor 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
poor quality and service 0 
battery life is real good 1 
returned 8 hours later 0 
best of all is the rotating feature very helpful 1 
comfort for our whole family 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i received it quickly and it works great 1 
my 5year old nokia 2160 from tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this 0 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
i am also very happy with the price 1 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
a piece of junk that broke after being on my phone for 2 days 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
love this phone 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
same problem as others have mentioned 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
price is good too 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
ive also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which i always turn it on and then off again 0 
nice solid keyboard 1 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
a disappointment 0 
its not user friendly 0 
i had verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service 1 
works as described 1 
the bose noise cancelling is amazing which is very important for a nyc commuter 1 
greatno problems at all 1 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
no real improvement 0 
all it took was one drop from about 6 inches above the kitchen counter and it was crackedi am not impressed and i am not laughing 0 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
its a total package 1 
its aggravating 0 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
voice quality signal strength dropped calls 0 
better than expected 1 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
they are so cool 1 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
the worst phone from samsungcrap this crappy samsung e715 is the worst i have ever seeen 0 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
dont make the same mistake that i did and please dont buy this phone 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
much less than the jawbone i was going to replace it with 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
i have to use the smallest earpieces provided but it stays on pretty well 1 
poor quality 0 
not worth it 0 
unfortunately it will not recharge my iphone 4s despite connecting it from multiple power sources imac external battery wall outlet etc 0 
other than that the leather is nice and soft the fit is very tight the cut out for the face is a good shape 1 
it has everything i need and i couldnt ask for more 1 
arrived quickly and much less expensive than others being sold 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this blueant supertooth handsfree phone speaker is awesome 1 
they have been around for years and carries the highest quality of antiglare screen protector that i have found to date 1 
very cheap plastic creaks like an old wooden floor 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i dont think it would hold it too securly on your belt 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
doesnt do the job 0 
i would recommend it 1 
the shipping time was also very quick 1 
dont buy it 0 
reaching for the bottom row is uncomfortable and the send and end keys are not where i expect them to be3 0 
not good enough for the price 0 
comfortable in my hand 1 
it works 1 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
excellent dualpurpose headset 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
not nearly as good looking as the amazon picture makes it look 0 
how stupid is that 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
saggy floppy piece of junk 0 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
im returning them 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it is a joy to use 1 
very much disappointed with this company 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
excellent product 1 
sweetest phone 1 
i am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product 0 
phone falls out easily 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
a bit predictable 0 
its practically perfect in all of them  a true masterpiece in a sea of faux masterpieces 1 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
but its just not funny 0 
but even the talented carrell cant save this 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
the wind and the lion is well written and superbly acted 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
too politically correct 0 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
id advise anyone to go and see it 1 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
no plot whatsoever 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
crash is a depressing little nothing that provokes emotion but teaches you nothing if you already know racism and prejudice are bad things 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this film has no redeeming features 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
highly unrecommended 0 
garbo who showed right off the bat that her talents could carry over from the silent era i wanted to see some of her silent work but netflix doesnt seem to be stocking them 1 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
hitchcock is a great director 1 
secondly hitchcock pretty much perfected the thriller and chase movie 1 
i mean in a realistic world she would never have gotten into that ballet repertory the whole thing was quite pathetic 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
that was funny 1 
it was so funny 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
again lame 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
the writers were smack on and i think the best actors and actresses were a bonus to the showthese characters were so real 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i think it was robert ryans best film because he portrayed someone like my father and he was a schizophrenic in real lifemy father although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
the good cinematography also makes her and monica bellucci look very beautiful 1 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
i wont say any more i dont like spoilers so i dont want to be one but i believe this film is worth your time 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
about 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudosatanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen goth blush almost always in olde english and sometimes in latin that may or may not be made up words 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
initially the local sites in the film which was filmed here in buffalo intrigued me 1 
later i found myself lost in the power of the film 1 
i left the theater with a lilt in my step joy in my heart and hope for the human race 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the cg opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on microsoft slideshow for gods sake 0 
the budget was evidently very limited 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
dont miss it 1 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
excellent performance 1 
helen baxendale is a very credible lady macbeth who can be very cheerfull at times and sometimes she just looks like a naughty girl but deadly in her taste for blood and evil 1 
special mention should be made of the superb music score and sound effects which are an integral element in helping to make this such a memorable and enjoyable cartoon 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
the aerial scenes were welldone 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
its so bad its actually worth seeing just for that reason 0 
one of the worst shows of all time 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
it has a very good plot it holds your complete attention the acting is superb tom wilkinson was fantastic and emily watson was also very good 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
a standout scene 1 
this movie is also revealing 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i love the scream movies and all horror movies and this one ranks way up there 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
it was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part 1 
the acting from all involved and that includes those like shatner and nimoy is bad and washed out and making them seem as old as they look in real life the special effects are tacky like when spock has to rescue kirk on a jet pack when he falls down from a mountain 0 
the story unfolds in 18th century jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
i struggle to find anything bad to say about it 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
lot of holes in the plot theres nothing about how he became the emperor nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age 0 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
highly recommended for all ages although the younger set will probably not appreciate some of the more subtle references they will certainly appreciate one galley scene in particular 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
i felt asleep the first time i watched it so i can recommend it for insomniacs 0 
hated it 0 
i dont understand how this garbage got on the shelves of the movie store its not even a real movie 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i do not know if this was emilio estevezs directorial debut but the pacing the interplay and development of the characters as well as some clever camera work surrounding the character estevez plays all suggest a natural eye 1 
go rent it 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
each track commands sentiment actually contributing to the scenes and characters 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
crust is not good 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
a great touch 1 
service is also cute 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this was like the final blow 0 
i found this place by accident and i could not be happier 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
we ordered the duck rare and it was pink and tender on the inside with a nice char on the outside 1 
the portion was huge 1 
this place receives stars for their appetizers 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
delicious nyc bagels good selections of cream cheese real lox with capers even 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
crostini that came with the salad was stale 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
the staff is friendly and the joint is always clean 1 
this place is good 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
delicious 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
interesting decor 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
the jamaican mojitos are delicious 1 
the food is rich so order accordingly 1 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
like the other reviewer said you couldnt pay me to eat at this place again 0 
the greek dressing was very creamy and flavorful 1 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
i liked the patio and the service was outstanding 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
i did not expect this to be so good 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
best tacos in town by far 1 
rude inconsiderate management 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
no complaints 1 
ordered an appetizer and took 40 minutes and then the pizza another 10 minutes 0 
will not be back 0 
i am far from a sushi connoisseur but i can definitely tell the difference between good food and bad food and this was certainly bad food 0 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
definitely not worth the 3 i paid 0 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
this is was due to the fact that it took 20 minutes to be acknowledged then another 35 minutes to get our foodand they kept forgetting things 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
oh this is such a thing of beauty this restaurant 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
everything was good and tasty 1 
if you love authentic mexican food and want a whole bunch of interesting yet delicious meats to choose from you need to try this place 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
over rated 0 
their steaks are 100 recommended 1 
i hate those things as much as cheap quality black olives 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
it was awesome 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
the cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing 1 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
pretty awesome place 1 
ordered burger rare came in well done 0 
we were promptly greeted and seated 1 
what a mistake 0 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
what a great double cheeseburger 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
i wasnt really impressed with strip steak 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
that said our mouths and bellies were still quite pleased 1 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
awesome selection of beer 1 
one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didnt expect more tip than that 1 
the food was barely lukewarm so it must have been sitting waiting for the server to bring it out to us 0 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the block was amazing 1 
unfortunately it was not good 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i can say that the desserts were yummy 1 
very poor service 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
the food came out at a good pace 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
i started this review with two stars but im editing it to give it only one 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
my boyfriend tried the mediterranean chicken salad and fell in love 1 
after the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert 0 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
needless to say i wont be going back anytime soon 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the fries were not hot and neither was my burger 0 
the real disappointment was our waiter 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
appetite instantly gone 0
