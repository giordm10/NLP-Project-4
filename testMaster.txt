good case excellent value 1 
great for the jawbone 1 
he was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery 1 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i bought this to use with my kindle fire and absolutely loved it 1 
it is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
it has kept up very well 1 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
excellent bluetooth headset 1 
everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price ie 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
a week later after i activated it it suddenly died 0 
the headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
setup couldnt have been simpler 1 
what a waste 0 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
very disappointed 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
what a waste of time 0 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
works like a charm it work the same as the one i got with the phone 1 
i still maintain that monkeys shouldnt make headphones we just obviously dont share enough dna to copy the design over to humans 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
it makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call 0 
we are sending it back 0 
great price also 1 
i would highly recommend this 1 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
poor quality and service 0 
great earpiece 1 
works great 1 
very good phone 1 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
good price 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the phone gets extremely hot 0 
it is light easy to use and has very clear reception and transmission 1 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
poor sound quality 0 
i highly recommend these and encourage people to give them a try 1 
what a disappointment 0 
i highly recommend this device to everyone 1 
dont make the same mistake i did 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
awsome device works great 1 
very displeased 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
disappointed 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
the delivery was on time 1 
id like to return it 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
well im satisfied 1 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
mobile phone tools are a must have 1 
i received my orders well within the shipping timeframe everything was in good working order and overall i am very excited to have this source 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
great product for the price 1 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
it doesnt work in europe or asia 0 
very dissapointing performance 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
however bt headsets are currently not good for real time games like firstperson shooters since the audio delay messes me up 0 
im pleased 1 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
it felt too light and tinny 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you simply want a small flip phone look elsewhere as the extra bells whistles are mediocre 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great product 1 
worthwhile 1 
it was horrible 0 
this allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first 0 
it is simple to use and i like it 1 
i cant use this case because the smell is disgusting 0 
not what i wanted 0 
i tried talking real loud but shouting on the telephone gets old and i was still told it wasnt great 0 
does not work 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
gets a signal when other verizon phones wont 1 
good case 1 
doesnt work 0 
unfortunately it did not work 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
product is useless since it does not have enough charging current to charge the 2 cellphones i was planning to use it with 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
poor reliability 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
i have only had it for a few weeks but so far so good 1 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
having trouble with volume 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
this was utterly confusing at first which caused me to lose a couple of very very important contacts 0 
but despite these few flaws this case is of exceptional quality and well worth the additional costs of owning an official oem product 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
leopard print is wonderfully wild 1 
works good 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
there was so much hype over this phone that i assumed it was the best my mistake 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
the performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house because it is beautiful 1 
then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupid 0 
a great film by a great director 1 
1010 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
there was no chemistry between ben affleck and sandra bullock in this film and i couldnt understand why he would consider even leaving his wifetobe for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by 0 
the only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as mst3k fodder 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it was so boring 0 
this is a bad film with bad writing and good actorsan ugly cartoon crafted by paul haggis for people who cant handle anything but the bold strokes in storytellinga picture painted with crayons 0 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
john wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry 1 
i think that it is a must see older john wayne film 1 
he owns the film just as spacek owned coal miners daughter and quaid owned great balls of fire 1 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
that was funny 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the cinematography is simply stunning to say the least and the fx are nothing if not stateoftheart 1 
and there wasnt a single sour note struck actingwise either some surprisingly solid casting here 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
but when someone strives for greatness and poetry but delivers a muddled and often ridiculous story a bunch of disparate scenes pretentious dialogue then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as pretentious crap 0 
one more thing i can tolerate political incorrectness very well im all for artistic freedom and suspension of disbelief but the slavic female character was just too much 0 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
and i really did find them funny 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
the hockey scenes are terrible defensemen playing like theyre 5 years old goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net etc 0 
in particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didnt work for me at all 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
i must say i have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again 1 
much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy 1 
i am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there letting is passion for art drive him and taking us as an audience with him 1 
this was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of ebay 1 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
i rather enjoyed it 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i am not a filmmaker nor am i a director but i would hide my head in the sand if id spent whatever amount of money and time on this movie 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
my 810 score is mostly for the plot 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
what this film lacks is a convincing script 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the casting is also horrible cause all you see is a really really bad actors period 0 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by edward chodorov who also produced and is surprisingly directed by jean negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more 0 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
first of all there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
the explosion of the gas tanks at the end was just as awful 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
not recommended 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
to be honest with you this is unbelievable nonsense and very foolish 0 
in conclusion i will not bother with this movie because a volcano in los angeles is nothing but nonsense 0 
omit watching this 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
an instant classic with a great soundtrack and a catchy song during the ending credits 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
theres barely a boring moment in the film and there are plenty of humorous parts 1 
excellent performance 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
it is not good 0 
it felt like a very gripping intelligent stage play but without the overly theatrical feeling one actually gets from watching people on a stage which plays on everyones terror of a white lie escalating to monstrous consequences 1 
go and see it 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the football scenes at the end were perplexing 0 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
and it was boring 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
i loved it it was really scary 1 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
it was that year however that reminded us that huston was still at the top of his game as evinced by his faithful adaptation of james joyces acclaimed novella the dead 1 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
its like a bad two hour tv movie 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
the secondary plot line is incomprehensible and its relation to the primary plot line is mystifying 0 
hated it 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
people who like european films and art movies will like this movie 1 
go rent it 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
simply beautiful 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
at a time when it seems that film animation has been dominated by disneypixars cgi masterpieces it is both refreshing and comforting to know that miyazaki is still relying on traditional handdrawn animation to tell his charming and enchanting stories 1 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
a great touch 1 
i tried the cape cod ravoli chickenwith cranberrymmmm 1 
so they performed 1 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
ample portions and good prices 1 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the service was meh 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
the sweet potato fries were very good and seasoned well 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
the ambience is wonderful and there is music playing 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
check it out 1 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
bland not a liking this place for a number of reasons and i dont want to waste time on bad reviewing ill leave it at that 0 
i wouldnt return 0 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
we waited for forty five minutes in vain 0 
some highlights great quality nigiri here 1 
i ordered the voodoo pasta and it was the first time id had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
restaurant is always full but never a wait 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
the burger had absolutely no flavor the meat itself was totally bland the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
im not really sure how joeys was voted best hot dog in the valley by readers of phoenix magazine 0 
service is friendly and inviting 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
my friend loved the salmon tartar 1 
extremely tasty 1 
the service was a bit lacking 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the lighting is just dark enough to set the mood 1 
we had 7 at our table and the service was pretty fast 1 
i think not again 0 
you get incredibly fresh fish prepared with care 1 
good beer drink selection and good food selection 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i go to far too many places and ive never seen any restaurant that serves a 1 egg breakfast especially for 400 0 
pretty cool i would say 1 
server did a great job handling our large rowdy table 1 
they have great dinners 1 
the food was terrible 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
we walked away stuffed and happy about our first vegas buffet experience 1 
first time going but i think i will quickly become a regular 1 
i like steiners because its dark and it feels like a bar 1 
id love to go back 1 
nothing special 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the food was outstanding and the prices were very reasonable 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the steaks are all well trimmed and also perfectly cooked 1 
i loved it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
waitress was sweet and funny 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the best place in vegas for breakfast just check out a sat or sun 1 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
worst martini ever 0 
just spicy enough perfect actually 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
avoid this establishment 0 
i heart this place 1 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
very bad experience 0 
what a mistake 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
not much flavor to them and very poorly constructed 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i cant wait to go back 1 
i gave it 5 stars then and im giving it 5 stars now 1 
your staff spends more time talking to themselves than me 0 
very good food great atmosphere1 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
tonight i had the elk filet specialand it sucked 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
this is a great place to eat 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
my sashimi was poor quality being soggy and tasteless 0 
we will not be coming back 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the classic maine lobster roll was fantastic 1 
once you get inside youll be impressed with the place 1 
the first time i ever came here i had an amazing experience i still tell people how awesome the duck was 1 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
i have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this place deserves no stars 0 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
so flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat 1 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
worst foodservice ive had in a while 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
i love their fries and their beans 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the service was extremely slow 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
the chips and sals a here is amazing 1 
i felt insulted and disrespected how could you talk and judge another human being like that 0 
the ri style calamari was a joke 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
not good by any stretch of the imagination 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
but i dont like it 0 
your servers suck wait correction our server heimer sucked 0 
too bad cause i know its family owned i really wanted to like this place 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
food was below average 0 
the problem i have is that they charge 1199 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a subway sub which offers better and more amount of vegetables 0 
shrimp when i unwrapped it i live only 12 a mile from brushfire it was literally ice cold 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
appetite instantly gone 0
