so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
ive owned this phone for 7 months now and can say that its the best mobile phone ive had 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not loud enough and doesnt turn on like it should 0 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
i wear it everyday and it holds up very well 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
integrated seamlessly with the motorola razr phone 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the keyboard is a nice compromise between a full qwerty and the basic cell phone number keypad 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
what a waste of time 0 
audio quality is poor very poor 0 
i know that sounds funny but to me it seemed like sketchy technology that wouldnt work wellwell this one works great 1 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the sound quality is good and functionality is awesome 1 
i recently had problems where i could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected 0 
any ring toneoverall good phone to buy 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
im still infatuated with this phone 1 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
worst customer service ever 0 
worth every penny 1 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
reversible plug works great 1 
very good phone 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
also its slim enough to fit into my alarm clock docking station without removing the case 1 
phone now holds charge like it did when it was new 1 
the battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena 0 
rip off over charge shipping 0 
very comfortable 1 
very disappointing 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
excellent sound quality 1 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
fantastic earphones 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i would recommend purchasing the jabra jx10 series 2 which works flawlessly with my moto q go figure 1 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
very well made and fits my surefire gx2 perfectly 1 
we would recommend these to others 1 
the battery works great 1 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
its not user friendly 0 
save your money ive had this item for 11 months now 0 
well im satisfied 1 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
really ugly 0 
horrible had to switch 3 times 0 
the noise shield is incrediable 1 
bluetooth range is good a few days ago i left my phone in the trunk got a call and carried the conversation without a hitch 1 
small sleek impressive looking practical setup with ample storage in place 1 
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
no shifting no bubbling no peeling not even a scratch nothingi couldnt be more happier with my new one for the droid 1 
its aggravating 0 
all in all im quite satisfied with this purchase 1 
its a piece of crap 0 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
what possesed me to get this junk i have no idea 0 
for the price on amazon it is an excellent product which i would highly recommend 1 
those phones are working just fine now 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
worked very well paired with a treo 700w and as a skype headset on my pc using a usb bluetooth transceiver 1 
this is a great product sure beats using your fingers 1 
phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are 1 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
it is well made easy to access the phone and has a handy detachable belt clip 1 
truly awful 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
you cant beat the price on these 1 
so just beware 0 
this is simply the best bluetooth headset for sound quality 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
it dit not work most of the time with my nokia 5320 0 
fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is 1 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
the sound quality is excellent as well 1 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i highly recommend this case 1 
five star plus plus 1 
a good quality bargain i bought this after i bought a cheapy from big lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldnt hear me 1 
battery chargelife is quite long 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the only very disappointing thing was there was no speakerphone 0 
stay away from the q 0 
i have read others reviews here but i havent had any problem with it 1 
it works 1 
its been my choice headset for yearsgreat sound good volume good noise cancellation 1 
does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125 0 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
happy so far 1 
motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right 1 
as i said abovepretty useless 0 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
it is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
earbud piece breaks easily 0 
it fits so securely that the ear hook does not even need to be used and the sound is better directed through your ear canal 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
loved the casting of jimmy buffet as the science teacher 1 
it had some average acting from the main person and it was a low budget as you clearly can see 0 
how can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this 1 
the story itself is just predictable and lazy 0 
its hard not to fall headoverheels in love with that girl 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
plus it was wellpaced and suited its relatively short run time 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
this was a poor remake of my best friends wedding 0 
all in all a great disappointment 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
again no plot at all 0 
the story is beyond stupid 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
but this movie is definitely a below average rent 0 
the film is way too long 0 
jamie foxx absolutely is ray charles 1 
there are the usual hitchcock logic flaws 0 
woa talk about awful 0 
regrettably the film fails 0 
yet i enjoy watching it 1 
the acting sucked 0 
the concert sequences just sucked 0 
that was funny 1 
thanks good a movie like this was done and released 1 
it was forced like everything in this movie 0 
and dont even get me started on the jerky camerawork 0 
i recommend this for everyone who loves film movies anythinga work of art 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
it features an outlandish array of memorable psychotic but lovable nuts 1 
i am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
started watching this but didnt believe in any of the characters 0 
glad i didnt pay to see it 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is a really good show to watch 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
all this movie does is make you sick watching all these slackers make excuses for their stupid actions for 90 minutes 0 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
having to humour him just to get by and get through the day was so apt 1 
almost all of the songs in cover girl are oldfashioned and not very tuneful 0 
her role was played well 1 
i would have casted her in that role after ready the script 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
it just blew 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
110 and only because there is no setting for 010 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
youd have to have the iq of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming 0 
the plot such as it is is so derivative and predictable that the ending is like a mercy killing 0 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
everything about it is just bad 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
whatever prompted such a documentary is beyond me 0 
i wouldnt see this movie again for free 0 
so badwellits just bad 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
lewis blacks considerable talent is wasted here too as he is at his most incendiary when he is unrestrained which the pg13 rating certainly wont allow 0 
is it possible for a movie to get any worse than this 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great masters stable 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
a good film by a great director 1 
10 out of 10 stars 1 
i advise you to look out for it 1 
highly recommended a 1 
how awful she is 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
nothing new there 0 
what on earth is irons doing in this film 0 
but i thought his acting was skilled 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
nine out of ten for a truly lovely film 1 
this is one of the best italian thrillers of the early 70s 1 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
i saw it as a child on tv back in 1973 when it was the stranger and i loved it 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
the characters are fleshed out surprisingly well particularly grimes and blake and all the actors deliver their sharply scripted lines with just the right amount of deadpan tongue in cheek to make the dialogue both hilarious and realistic 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the film deserves strong kudos for taking this stand for having exceptional acting from its mostly lesserknown cast and for the superintelligent script that doesnt insult the audience or take the easy way out when it comes to white racism 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
trumbull on i love lucy 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
end of days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies ive ever seen 0 
he surely doesnt know how to make a coherent action movie from the screenwriter of air force one who was only obliged to write the script just for a big sum of money 0 
with great sound effects and impressive special effects i cant recommend this movie enough 1 
everything stinks 0 
great movie 1 
also the story and acting were weak 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
at any rate this film stinks its not funny and fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
im so sorry but i really cant recommend it to anyone 0 
hated it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
not easy to watch 0 
it was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen 1 
simply beautiful 1 
both rickman and stowe play their roles to the hilt in this tale of a childrens book writer who maybe has written a subversive tract 1 
both actors truly understand and become their particular character delivering a convincing sincere performance 1 
definitely worth seeing its the sort of thought provoking film that forces you to question your own threshold of loneliness 1 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
it is a very well acted and done tv movie 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it was a riot to see hugo weaving play a sexobsessed gay real estate salesman who uses his clients houses for his trysts with the flaming darren tom hollander 1 
lange had become a great actress 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
all in all its an insult to ones intelligence and a huge waste of money 0 
the selection on the menu was great and so were the prices 1 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
they never brought a salad we asked for 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
the worst was the salmon sashimi 0 
ample portions and good prices 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
if you want a sandwich just go to any firehouse 1 
they have horrible attitudes towards customers and talk down to each one when customers dont enjoy their food 0 
the salad had just the right amount of sauce to not over power the scallop which was perfectly cooked 1 
we are so glad we found this place 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this place has it 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the poor batter to meat ratio made the chicken tenders very unsatisfying 0 
its like a really sexy party in your mouth where youre outrageously flirting with the hottest person at the party 1 
best breakfast buffet 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i loved their mussels cooked in this wine reduction the duck was tender and their potato dishes were delicious 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
the guys all had steaks and our steak loving son who has had steak at the best and worst places said it was the best steak hes ever eaten 1 
host staff were for lack of a better word bitches 0 
phenomenal food service and ambiance 1 
penne vodka excellent 1 
dont do it 0 
the service was a little slow considering that were served by 3 people servers so the food was coming in a slow pace 0 
the waitresses are very friendly 1 
everything on the menu is terrific and we were also thrilled that they made amazing accommodations for our vegetarian daughter 1 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
we literally sat there for 20 minutes with no one asking to take our order 0 
i also decided not to send it back because our waitress looked like she was on the verge of having a heart attack 0 
i ordered the lemon raspberry ice cocktail which was also incredible 1 
also were served hot bread and butter and home made potato chips with bacon bits on topvery original and very good 1 
very friendly staff 1 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
extremely tasty 1 
waitress was good though 1 
which are small and not worth the price 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is the place where i first had pho and it was amazing 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
there is nothing privileged about workingeating there 0 
thus far have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time 1 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
the goat taco didnt skimp on the meat and wow what flavor 1 
this place is amazing 1 
the staff is great the food is delish and they have an incredible beer selection 1 
never again will i be dining at this place 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the food was very good 1 
first the bathrooms at this location were dirty seat covers were not replenished just plain yucky 0 
omg the food was delicioso 1 
its worth driving up from tucson 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it was delicious 1 
my wife had the lobster bisque soup which was lukewarm 0 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
they will customize your order any way youd like my usual is eggplant with green bean stir fry love it 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
i never come again 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
we loved the place 1 
the vanilla ice cream was creamy and smooth while the profiterole choux pastry was fresh enough 1 
great pork sandwich 1 
the selection of food was not the best 0 
how awesome is that 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
everything was perfect the night we were in 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
my boyfriend and i came here for the first time on a recent trip to vegas and could not have been more pleased with the quality of food and service 1 
i think this restaurant suffers from not trying hard enough 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
great place fo take out or eat in 1 
the waitress was friendly and happy to accomodate for veganveggie options 1 
i will not be eating there again 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
any grandmother can make a roasted chicken better than this one 0 
tried to go here for lunch and it was a madhouse 0 
the macarons here are insanely good 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
the owners are super friendly and the staff is courteous 1 
the sweet potato tots were good but the onion rings were perfection or as close as i have had 1 
dessert panna cotta was amazing 1 
the steak was amazingrge fillet relleno was the best seafood plate i have ever had 1 
i was mortified 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
would not recommend to others 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
will not be back 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
main thing i didnt enjoy is that the crowd is of older crowd around mid 30s and up 0 
the chicken dishes are ok the beef is like shoe leather 0 
great time family dinner on a sunday night 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
im super pissd 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
the crêpe was delicate and thin and moist 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
very poor service 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
i paid the bill but did not tip because i felt the server did a terrible job 0 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
i ate there twice on my last visit and especially enjoyed the salmon salad 1 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
go to place for gyros 1 
after 20 minutes wait i got a table 0 
seriously killer hot chai latte 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
very very sad 0 
the only thing i wasnt too crazy about was their guacamole as i dont like it puréed 0 
the food is about on par with dennys which is to say not good at all 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
the sangria was about half of a glass wine full and was 12 ridiculous 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
this place is horrible and way overpriced 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
del taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible 0 
food was below average 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
the whole experience was underwhelming and i think well just go to ninja sushi next time 0
