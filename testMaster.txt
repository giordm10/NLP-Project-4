tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutesmajor problems 0 
i have to jiggle the plug to get it to line up right to get decent volume 0 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i was not impressed by this product 0 
good protection and does not make phone too bulky 1 
a usable keyboard actually turns a pda into a realworld useful machine instead of just a neat gadget 1 
the buttons for on and off are bad 0 
i really recommend this faceplates since it looks very nice elegant and cool 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
even in my bmw 3 series which is fairly quiet i have trouble hearing what the other person is saying 0 
well packaged arrived on time and works as intended 1 
dont waste your money 0 
will order from them again 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
sound quality on both end is excellent i use headset to call my wife and ask my wife to use headset to call me 2 1 
absolutely great 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
buyerbe very careful 0 
this item is fantastic and works perfectly 1 
and i just love the colors 1 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
i put the latest os on it v115g and it now likes to slow to a crawl and lock up every once in a while 0 
great phone 1 
waste of 13 bucks 0 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
if you hate earbugs avoid this phone by all means 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
these are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent 1 
im a bit disappointed 0 
no additional ear gels provided and no instructions whatsoever 0 
internet is excrutiatingly slow 0 
it is very comfortable to wear as well which is probably the most important aspect about using a case 1 
poor quality and service 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality 1 
excellent phone 1 
good price 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
very disappointing 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it worked very well 1 
price is good too 1 
its really easy 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
low quality 0 
if you dont find it too bad as again the unit comes with one earpad onlyi would not recommend this to anyone 0 
i might have gotten a defect but i would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone 0 
i searched the internet and found this one to be the best value 1 
very happy with this product 1 
not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
uncomfortable in the ear dont use with lg vx9900 env 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
a disappointment 0 
unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
you never know if you pushed it hard enough or the right number of times for the function you want or not 0 
i am very impressed with the job that motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
its a total package 1 
its aggravating 0 
none of it works just dont buy it 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
this fixes all the problems 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
verizon tech support walked my through a few procedures none of which worked and i ended up having to do a hard reset wiping out all my data 0 
better than new 1 
overall i would recommend this phone over the new walkman 1 
all the other cases ive tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul 1 
very dissapointing performance 0 
you get what you pay for i guess 0 
not only did the software do a great job of this i could also make my own ringtones form my existing cds without an internet connection 1 
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and theres not much reviews about it 1 
finally after three or four times the spring of the latch broke and i could not use it any longer on the visor 0 
the handsfree part works fine but then the car tries to download the address book and the treo rebootsoverall i still rate this device high 1 
im happy about this purchase good quality and low price 1 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
easy to pair with my samsung cell 1 
too bad you have to pay up to a month for the service 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
poor quality 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
think it over when you plan to own this onethis sure is the last moto phone for me 0 
the design is very good4 1 
couldnt use the unit with sunglasses not good in texas 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
does not fit 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the reception has been generally good 1 
i am sorry i made this purchase 0 
2 thumbs up to this seller 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i would recommend it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
doesnt work 0 
this is an excellent tool especially when paired with your phones autoanswer 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
fits comfortably came with three sizes of earbud tips 1 
the pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before i started making calls with the voice dialing feature 1 
terrible phone holder 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
while i managed to bend the leaf spring back in place the metal now has enough stress that it will break on the next drop 0 
it also had a new problem 0 
cool phone 1 
however after about a year the fliptop started to get loose and wobbly and eventually my screen went black and i couldnt receive and place calls 0 
logitech bluetooth headset is a 10 1 
im returning them 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and im pretty happy with that decision 1 
i cannot make calls at certain places 0 
beautiful styling though 1 
this company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back 0 
a bit predictable 0 
it was so cool 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
actually the graphics were good at the time 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
i do think tom hanks is a good actor 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
alexander nevsky is a great film 1 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
if there was ever a movie that needed wordofmouth to promote this is it 1 
give this one a look 1 
it is a true classic 1 
i love lane but ive never seen her in a movie this lousy 0 
and generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode 0 
1010 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i had to walk out of the theatre for a few minutes just to get some relief 0 
awful 0 
nobody identifies with these characters because theyre all cardboard cutouts and stereotypes or predictably reversestereotypes 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i was left shattered from the experience of watching this film and i took a good two hours to fully recover 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
that was nice 1 
that was funny 1 
but this movie is not funny considering the ridiculousness of it 0 
it is an excellent drama an excellent thriller and an excellent film 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
i thoroughly enjoyed it when christopher eccleston took control of the tardis and the continuation of the series 1 
there is a lot of beautiful places 1 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
this is such a fun and funny movie 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
is pretty funny 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different characters on screen 1 
i felt as though her going to ireland did absolutely nothing whatsoever 0 
there was a few pathetic attempts to give the characters some depth but it didnt really work into the rest of the plot 0 
i guess it was supposed to be clever twist then shed some light on the situation but it was just stupid 0 
the stories were powerful explorations of the nature of man and of art 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
a good commentary of todays love and undoubtedly a film worth seeing 1 
for people who are first timers in film making i think they did an excellent job 1 
i am a fan of his this movie sucked really bad 0 
i let my girlfriend talk me into seeing this bad idea we both hated it 0 
wow what a bad film 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
hackneyed writing certainly but made even worse by the bad directing 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
this movie creates its own universe and is fascinating in every way 1 
see it 1 
about half way through this film i started to dislike it 0 
the cast is good 1 
for that its worth checking out 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
i could not understand what kind of idiot would produce this mess in the first place not to mention several season 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
rating 010 grade z note the show is so bad that even mother of the cast pull her daughter out of the show 0 
very serious spoilers this movie was a huge disappointment 0 
steve martin delivers a really funny performance of a middleaged upper class uptight white guy 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
while you dont yet hear mickey speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
and the accents are absolutely abysmal 0 
theres also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
dont miss it 1 
i saw this film over christmas and what a great film it was 1 
but it wasnt until i watched this film that i realised how great he actually was 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
very true to shakespear and a must for all shakespear fans 1 
this is a witty and delightful adaptation of the dr seuss book brilliantly animated by upas finest and thoroughly deserving of its academy award 1 
all of the main players are mesmerising 1 
this is just a great movie 1 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear you see kids pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show 0 
im big fan of rpg games too but this movie its a disgrace to any selfrespecting rpger there is 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
very nice and relaxing late night viewing 1 
and it was boring 0 
the film has an ultracheap look to it 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
none of them are engaging or exciting 0 
predictable but not a bad watch 1 
constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations 1 
in fact this stinker smells like a directtovideo release 0 
the acting as youd expect from this cast is top notch 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
juano hernandez an exceptional actor who played supporting roles in many films of the era is a proud black man who is accused of murdering a white man in the south 1 
see both films if you can 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
but kevin spacey is an excellent verbal tsunami as buddy ackerman  and totally believable because he is a great actor 1 
everything captain howdy says is either laughable or just plain stupid 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
avoid this film at all costs 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the acting is like watching wooden puppets moving around and reading from a book thats how bad it is 0 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the story line is totally predictable 0 
really awful 0 
just whatever you do avoid groove as its the antithesis of all that is good about human traffic 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
i have recommended it to friends 1 
the incredible soundtrack truly captures the essence of the film 1 
recommend with confidence 1 
wow loved this place 1 
would not go back 0 
the food amazing 1 
overall i like this place a lot 1 
its too bad the food is so damn generic 0 
the burger is good beef cooked just right 1 
the cocktails are all handmade and delicious 1 
always a great time at dos gringos 1 
we got the food and apparently they have never heard of salt and the batter on the fish was chewy 0 
the service was meh 0 
the turkey and roast beef were bland 0 
omelets are to die for 1 
the food was delicious our bartender was attentive and personable and we got a great deal 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
although i very much liked the look and sound of this place the actual experience was a bit disappointing 0 
this place is way too overpriced for mediocre food 0 
i had a seriously solid breakfast here 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
my drink was never empty and he made some really great menu suggestions 1 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
the bathrooms are clean and the place itself is well decorated 1 
the menu is always changing food quality is going down service is extremely slow 0 
this place is good 1 
i was seated immediately 1 
ive never been treated so bad 0 
i dressed up to be treated so rudely 0 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
interesting decor 1 
the worst experience ever 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
very very fun chef 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
now this dish was quite flavourful 1 
the veggitarian platter is out of this world 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this place is not quality sushi it is not a quality restaurant 0 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
in the summer you can dine in a charming outdoor patio so very delightful 1 
never going back 0 
service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews 1 
the black eyed peas and sweet potatoes unreal 1 
you wont be disappointed 1 
i love this place 1 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
it was delicious 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
they dropped more than the ball 0 
the dining space is tiny but elegantly decorated and comfortable 1 
and the beans and rice were mediocre at best 0 
the service was outshining i definitely recommend the halibut 1 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
gave up trying to eat any of the crust teeth still sore 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
so absolutley fantastic 1 
will not be back 0 
im in az all the time and now have my new spot 1 
this was my first and only vegas buffet and it did not disappoint 1 
third the cheese on my friends burger was cold 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
it was a drive to get there 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
not even a hello we will be right with you 0 
i guess maybe we went on an off night but it was disgraceful 0 
the servers went back and forth several times not even so much as an are you being helped 0 
food was delicious 1 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the staff are also very friendly and efficient 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
after i pulled up my car i waited for another 15 minutes before being acknowledged 0 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
i got home to see the driest damn wings ever 0 
couldnt ask for a more satisfying meal 1 
i just wanted to leave 0 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
sorry i will not be getting food from here anytime soon 0 
despite how hard i rate businesses its actually rare for me to give a 1 star 0 
they really want to make your experience a good one 1 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
it was just not a fun experience 1 
the atmosphere was great with a lovely duo of violinists playing songs we requested 1 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
and the chef was generous with his time even came around twice so we can take pictures with him 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
i was mortified 0 
after one bite i was hooked 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
special thanks to dylan t for the recommendation on what to order all yummy for my tummy 1 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
it was way over fried 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
perfect for someone me who only likes beer ice cold or in this case even colder 1 
we will not be coming back 0 
and service was super friendly 1 
the service was terrible though 0 
this place should honestly be blown up 0 
i do love sushi but i found kabuki to be overpriced overhip and underservices 0 
they were excellent 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small 0 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
they have a plethora of salads and sandwiches and everything ive tried gets my seal of approval 1 
the service was great even the manager came and helped with our table 1 
weird vibe from owners 0 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
the service was terrible food was mediocre 0 
we definately enjoyed ourselves 1 
i ordered albondigas soup which was just warm and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs 0 
if you stay in vegas you must get breakfast here at least once 1 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
their regular toasted bread was equally satisfying with the occasional pats of butter mmmm 1 
we wont be returning 0 
im not impressed with the concept or the food 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
very slow at seating even with reservation 0 
the cashew cream sauce was bland and the vegetables were undercooked 0 
i was very disappointed 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
the tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
its not hard to make a decent hamburger 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0 
appetite instantly gone 0
