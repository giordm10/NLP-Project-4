so there is no way for me to plug it in here in the us unless i go by a converter 0 
great for the jawbone 1 
if you have several dozen or several hundred contacts then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one 0 
works great 1 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
i only hear garbage for audio 0 
this phone is pretty sturdy and ive never had any large problems with it 1 
essentially you can forget microsofts tech support 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
great for ipods too 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the battery runs down quickly 0 
product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and boy was it cheaper 1 
buyer beware you could flush money right down the toilet 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
ive tried several different earpieces for my cell phone and this jabra one is the first one ive found that fits my ear comfortably 1 
headset works great was packaged nicely to avoid any damage 1 
ive bought 5 wired headphones that sound better than these 0 
nice quality build unlike some cheap s out there 1 
great charger 1 
this is essentially a communications tool that does not communicate 0 
excellent service 1 
the pleather case doesnt fit 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
good transmit audio 1 
worst phone ever 0 
simple lightweight and great fit 1 
i ordered this for sony ericsson w810i but i think it only worked once thats when i first used it 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
it defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset 0 
worked perfectly 1 
good product good seller 1 
i love this bluetooth 1 
i got it because it was so small and adorable 1 
poorly contstruct hinge 0 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
someone shouldve invented this sooner 1 
this is a good battery and it got here really fast 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the battery is working well as a replacement for the original that came with the phone over 2 years ago 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
this little device has transformed my organizational capability and made my life a whole lot easier 1 
excellent starter wireless headset 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
i had ordered a motorola data cable got a very well finished and working product 1 
the worst phone ive ever had only had it for a few months 0 
you can even take self portraits with the outside exterior display very cool 1 
using all earpieces left or right this thing will not stay on my ear 0 
very prompt service 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its so stupid to have to keep buying new chargers car chargers cradles headphones and car kits every time a new phone comes out 0 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
but it does get better reception and clarity than any phone ive had before 1 
restored my phone to like new performance 1 
timely shipment and quality product 1 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
it holds a charge for a long time is reasonably comfortable under longwearing conditions and the quality of sound is tremendous 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
then i exchanged for the same phone even that had the same problem 0 
this results in the phone being either stuck at max volume or mute 0 
it is super charged up for use as a small hybrid palmtopcameracellphone and excels in those roles 1 
this battery is an excellent bargain 1 
defective crap 0 
the holster that arrived did not match the photo in the ad 0 
the phone is sturdy and waterproof 1 
no real improvement 0 
they refuse to refund or replace 0 
great case and price 1 
ive missed numerous calls because of this reason 0 
dont buy this product 0 
cumbersome design 0 
great product 1 
i got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was brokeni went to plug it in and it started smoking 0 
linked to my phone without effort 1 
sprint charges for this service 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
i was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price 1 
do not buy do not buyit sucks 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
great phone 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
setup went very smoothly 1 
a must study for anyone interested in the worst sins of industrial design 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
comes with a strong light that you can use to light up your camera shots and even flash sos signals seriously 1 
it was a great phone 1 
my phone doesnt slide around my car now and the grip prevents my phone from slipping out of my hand 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the tracfonewebsite is user friendly and makes it easy toactivate etc 1 
it is light has plenty of battery capacity and is very confortable to wear for somewhat extended periods of time 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
i really wanted the plantronics 510 to be the right one but it has too many issues for methe good 0 
excellent sound battery life and inconspicuous to boot 1 
great bluetooth 1 
after my phone got to be about a year old its been slowly breaking despite much care on my part 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
great phone 1 
the calls drop the phone comes on and off at will the screen goes black and the worst of all it stops ringing intermittently 0 
its not what it says it is 0 
poor reliability 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
but in any case the best part is you can download these pictures to your laptop using ir or even send pictures from your laptop to the phone 1 
nice case feels good in your hands 1 
works fine 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
this is by far the worst purchase ive made on amazon 0 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
so i bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money 1 
it always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
cool phone 1 
i kept catching the cable on the seat and i had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
otherwise easy to install and use clear sound 1 
im trying to return it for a refund 0 
dont waste your money 0 
the text messaging feature is really tricky to use 0 
im really disappointed all i have now is a charger that doesnt work 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
yes this film does require a rather significant amount of puzzlesolving but the pieces fit together to create a beautiful picture 1 
there are massive levels massive unlockable characters its just a massive game 1 
the very idea of it was lame take a minor character from a mediocre pg13 film and make a complete nonsequel while changing its tone to a pgrated family movie 0 
in addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written french cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen 1 
excellent cast story line performances 1 
all in all i give this one a resounding 9 out of 10 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
give this one a look 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the only suspense i was feeling was the frustration at just how retarded the girls were 0 
the acting was bad the dialogs were extremely shallow and insincere 0 
too politically correct 0 
the directing and the cinematography arent quite as good 0 
the directing seems too pretentious 0 
the movie had you on the edge of your seat and made you somewhat afraid to go to your car at the end of the night 1 
it rocked my world and is certainly a must see for anyone with no social or physical outlets 1 
i guess that nobody at the network that aired this dribble watched it before putting it on 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
the fish is badly made and some of its underwater shots are repeated a thousand times in the film 0 
the acting is terrible and the writing is worse 0 
i dont think ive ever gone to a movie and disliked it as much 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the script is was there a script 0 
ill even say it again  this is torture 0 
yes its that bad 0 
its also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter frances marion hasnt missed a step going from silent to sound 1 
there were too many close ups 0 
ray charles is legendary 1 
this is a chilly unremarkable movie about an author livingworking in a chilly abstruse culture 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
do not waste your time 0 
but what really made it unwatchable was the direction 0 
the cinematographyif it can be called thatsucked 0 
the acting sucked 0 
the attention given to every character and complex psychological portrayals detailing loyalty treachery love and hope are tremendous 1 
everything about this film is simply incredible 1 
if it was to turn my good day feeling into a night of disturbing memories than i guess he succeeded 0 
summary the witticisms werent witty 0 
camerawork again bad 0 
rating 1 out of 10 0 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i literally vomited while watching this film 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
i will never forget it now 1 
by the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant i was bored and didnt care what happened next and so i switched off 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
i would give this television series a 10 plus if i could 1 
the things that the four kids get themselves into is absolutely hilarious to watch 1 
this is one of the best movies out there that shows such strong sibling bond for each other 1 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
after watching this film i wanted to learn more about the works of this artist 1 
my mother and brother had to do thiswhen i saw robert ryan portraying this type of man it was a very good imitation of this type of individual and i was impressed 1 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
her role was played well 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
that movie was bad 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
almost everyone involved must be return to school acting is utterly predictable and bad script is pile of garbage all round 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this gets a 1 out of 10 simply because theres nothing lower 0 
but the premise of the film was so ridiculous that the president of the us 0 
the only thing worse than taylors acting was stanwycks singing 0 
the awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time 0 
of course the acting is blah 0 
i have seen many movies starring jaclyn smith but my god this was one of her best though it came out 12 years ago 1 
totally different with loads of understatement and black comedy this is a film few get to see but those who do will remember it 1 
it is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show i have ever seen 0 
it is zillion times away from reality 0 
watching washing machine twirling around wouldnt hurt your eyes as much as this show 0 
the movie is littered with overt racial slurs towards the black cast members and in return the whites are depicted as morons and boobs 0 
this second appearance of mickey mouse following the silent plane crazy earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking 1 
however after seeing the short again after about 25 years i was amazed at how timeless the film actually is 1 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
this may be the only bad film he ever made 0 
this convention never worked well in the past and certainly doesnt work here 0 
okay i like to consider myself a fair critic so ill give credit where credits duethe creature effects were actually pretty cool 1 
its just painful 0 
the characters are interesting and you really care for them 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
overall a delight 1 
also great directing and photography 1 
macbeth jason connery moved me to tears with his final monolog out brief candle outhe gave the sphere of moral decay and dark forces a human face which makes it the more interesting 1 
even allowing for poor production values for the time 1971 and the format some kind of miniseries this is baaaaaad 0 
go and see it 1 
kris kristoffersen is good in this movie and really makes a difference 1 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
but she is still a bad actress repeating her robotic face moves in each of her pictures 0 
the show would begin with smart ass ed comments to each other that would be totally off the wall and uncalled for 0 
the success of the film depends on the casting of sydney greenstreet as the alexander yardley character 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the transfers are very good 1 
some great music and terrific scenery 1 
the plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
and it was boring 0 
all the actors give a wonderful performance especially jennifer rubin as jamie harris who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star 1 
you learn a lot about the real inside emotions of people in this movie and a lot about the movie business itself 1 
but the duet between the astronaut and his doctor at the beginning of the movie is a perfect exchange if one considers that this movie was made well into the cold war and the astronauts biggest fear is that he has crashed in the ussr 1 
it is wonderful and inspiring to watch and i hope that it gets released again on to video or dvd 1 
editing the editing of this film was phenomenal in my opinion 1 
when achille and philippa beautifully sing a duet from don giovanni that perfectly describes their situation in the movie you appreciate the subtle layers of this excellent film 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the warmth it generates is in contrast to its austere backdrop 1 
its a long time since i was so entertained by a movie 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
1 hour 54 minutes of sheer tedium melodrama and horrible acting a mess of a script and a sinking feeling of good lord what were they thinking 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great movie 1 
he cant act one of the least scary villains i have ever seen he cant write did he write this damn movie in his sleep 0 
this is probably one of the least effective and utterly unoriginal films i have ever seen in my entire life 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
the scenery that the two daughters paint and photograph are beautiful 1 
this is truly an art movieit actually has a lot of art in it 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
enough can not be said of the remarkable animation in this film 1 
if you havent choked in your own vomit by the end by all the cheap drama and worthless dialogue youve must have bored yourself to death with this waste of time 0 
instead we got a bore fest about a whiny spoiled brat babysitting 0 
if you have not seen this movie i definitely recommend it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
stopped by during the late may bank holiday off rick steve recommendation and loved it 1 
highly recommended 1 
the burrittos blah 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
seems like a good quick place to grab a bite of some familiar pub food but do yourself a favor and look elsewhere 0 
service sucks 0 
on a positive note our server was very attentive and provided great service 1 
wed definitely go back here again 1 
updatewent back for a second time and it was still just as amazing 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the scallop dish is quite appalling for value as well 0 
2 times very bad customer service 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
all i have to say is the food was amazing 1 
this is one of the better buffets that i have been to 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
check it out 1 
we thought youd have to venture further away to get good sushi but this place really hit the spot that night 1 
he was extremely rude and really there are so many other restaurants i would love to dine at during a weekend in vegas 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food 1 
unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was stale 0 
i came back today since they relocated and still not impressed 0 
delicious 1 
love this place hits the spot when i want something healthy but not lacking in quantity or flavor 1 
the food sucked which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined 0 
you can watch them preparing the delicious food 1 
when my order arrived one of the gyros was missing 0 
i had a salad with the wings and some ice cream for dessert and left feeling quite satisfied 1 
ive never been more insulted or felt disrespected 0 
must have been an off night at this place 0 
hopefully this bodes for them going out of business and someone who can cook can come in 0 
if the food isnt bad enough for you then enjoy dealing with the worlds worstannoying drunk people 0 
ordered a double cheeseburger got a single patty that was falling apart picture uploaded yeah still sucks 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
seriously flavorful delights folks 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the service was not up to par either 0 
just as good as when i had it more than a year ago 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
before i go in to why i gave a 1 star rating please know that this was my third time eating at bachi burger before writing a review 0 
the food was excellent and service was very good 1 
fantastic food 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i love this place 1 
the selection was probably the worst ive seen in vegasthere was none 0 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
everyone is treated equally special 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
definitely a turn off for me i doubt ill be back unless someone else is buying 0 
would come back again if i had a sushi craving while in vegas 1 
i left with a stomach ache and felt sick the rest of the day 0 
the food was terrible 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
kids pizza is always a hit too with lots of great side dish options for the kiddos 1 
total waste of time 0 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
come hungry leave happy and stuffed 1 
but now i was completely grossed out 0 
service is quick and friendly 1 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
we asked for the bill to leave without eating and they didnt bring that either 0 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
my gyro was basically lettuce only 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
this was my first time and i cant wait until the next 1 
if there were zero stars i would give it zero stars 0 
great steak great sides great wine amazing desserts 1 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
no im going to eat the potato that i found some strangers hair in it 0 
the desserts were a bit strange 0 
after two i felt disgusting 0 
a good time 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
our server was super nice and checked on us many times 1 
my breakfast was perpared great with a beautiful presentation of 3 giant slices of toast lightly dusted with powdered sugar 1 
omg i felt like i had never eaten thai food until this dish 1 
not good for the money 0 
same evening him and i are both drastically sick 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
eclectic selection 1 
the staff was very attentive 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
awesome service and food 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
good food good service 1 
it was absolutely amazing 1 
the sergeant pepper beef sandwich with auju sauce is an excellent sandwich as well 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i work in the hospitality industry in paradise valley and have refrained from recommending cibo any longer 0 
overall i like there food and the service 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
probably never coming back and wouldnt recommend it 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
when i opened the sandwich i was impressed but not in a good way 0 
wonderful lil tapas and the ambience made me feel all warm and fuzzy inside 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
the service was poor and thats being nice 0 
both the hot sour the egg flower soups were absolutely 5 stars 1 
the flair bartenders are absolutely amazing 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
join the club and get awesome offers via email 1 
the chips and salsa were really good the salsa was very fresh 1 
and service was super friendly 1 
this place is overpriced not consistent with their boba and it really is overpriced 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
for 40 bucks a head i really expect better food 0 
in fact im going to round up to 4 stars just because she was so awesome 1 
bad day or not i have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people it is your job to be nice and polite wash dishes otherwise 0 
hot dishes are not hot cold dishes are close to room tempi watched staff prepare food with bare hands no gloveseverything is deep fried in oil 0 
the feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best 0 
pricing is a bit of a concern at mellow mushroom 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
we arent ones to make a scene at restaurants but i just dont get itdefinitely lost the love after this one 0 
disappointing experience 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
the building itself seems pretty neat the bathroom is pretty trippy but i wouldnt eat here again 0 
it wasnt busy at all and now we know why 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
but i dont like it 0 
unfortunately it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees 0 
i kept looking at the time and it had soon become 35 minutes yet still no food 0 
all in all ha long bay was a bit of a flop 0 
spend your money and time some place else 0 
i cant tell you how disappointed i was 0
