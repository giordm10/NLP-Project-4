the mic is great 1 
i advise everyone do not be fooled 0 
i have two more years left in this contract and i hate this phone 0 
you need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phonebattery life is short 0 
i even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
nice docking station for home or work 1 
this is a beautiful phone 1 
i love this phone it is very handy and has a lot of features 1 
this phone works great 1 
the ear buds only play music in one ear 0 
best ive found so far ive tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality for both me and the listener as well as ease of using 1 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i love my 350 headset my jabra350 bluetooth headset is great the reception is very good and the ear piece is a comfortable fit 1 
iam very pleased with my purchase 1 
gets the job done 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
during several different 2 minute calls i experienced 5 drops and it was in an area that had 5 bars 0 
i got this phone on reccomendation from a relative and im glad i did 1 
what a waste of time 0 
all i can do is whine on the internet so here it goesthe more i use the thing the less i like it 0 
doesnt work at all i bougth it for my l7c and its not working 0 
excellent service 1 
it only recognizes the phone as its storage device 0 
useless phone simply deaf 0 
worst phone ever 0 
great sound and service 1 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
do not make the same mistake as me 0 
the phone was unusable and was not new 0 
nice headphones for the price and they work great 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
works great 1 
absolutel junk 0 
first of all it doesnt wear well 0 
this is hands down the best phone ive ever had 1 
works great when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
good price 1 
its uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone razr or with my previous wired headset that plugged into an lg 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i want my money back 0 
very comfortable 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
very clear quality sound and you dont have to mess with the sound on your ipod since you have the sound buttons on the headset 1 
1 long lasting battery you dont have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones2 0 
it was an inexpensive piece but i would still have expected better quality 0 
it is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after i bought it 0 
the loudspeaker option is great the bumpers with the lights is very appealing 0 
the microphone also works well but according to people i have called it applifies everything 1 
battery life is also great 1 
this is a very average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network 0 
exactly what i wanted 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
very pleased with this headset 1 
plantronics bluetooth excelent buy 1 
jawbone era is awesome too 1 
im using it with an iriver spinn with case and it fits fine 1 
overall i am psyched to have a phone which has all my appointments and contacts in and gets great reception 1 
every thing on phone work perfectly she like it 1 
my sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect 1 
it finds my cell phone right away when i enter the car 1 
does not fit 0 
cant get the software to work with my computer 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
i find this inexcusable and so will probably be returning this phone and perhaps changing carriers 0 
id like to return it 0 
after charging overnight these batteries work great 1 
i love this phone 1 
i would definitely recommend the jabra bt250v for those who are looking for comfort clarity and a great price 1 
as an earlier review noted plug in this charger and nothing happens 0 
thanks again to amazon for having the things i need for a good price 1 
i am glad i purchased it 1 
trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration 0 
great it was new packaged nice works good no problems and it came in less time then i expected 1 
my experience was terrible this was my fourth bluetooth headset and while it was much more comfortable than my last jabra which i hated 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
better than expected 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this is a great phone 1 
their research and development division obviously knows what theyre doing 1 
poor construction 0 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
very windresistant 1 
they do not last forever but is not overly expensive to replaceeasy to operate and the sound is much better than others i have tried 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
its welldesigned and very sharp the blue is a very nice color 1 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
do not buy if you want to use the holster 0 
because both ears are occupied background is not distracting at all 1 
also the phone doesnt seem to accept anything except cbr mp3s preferably ripped by windows media player 0 
lightweight and works well 1 
in the span of an hour i had two people exclaim whoa is that the new phone on tv 1 
none of the three sizes they sent with the headset would stay in my ears 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
does not fit 0 
the camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors id rather be using a disposable then this 0 
this particular model would not work with my motorola q smartphone 0 
in addition it feels amp looks as if the phone is all lightweight cheap plastic 0 
it was horrible 0 
not what i wanted 0 
50 down the drain 0 
improper description i had to return it 0 
dont buy it 0 
i dont like this nokia either 0 
terrible product and waste of money 0 
would recommend this item 1 
i received my headset in good time and was happy with it 1 
good quality 1 
it seems completely secure both holding on to my belt and keeping the iphone inside 1 
the only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears 1 
i am pairing this with my iphone and i could not be happier with it so far 1 
i didnt want the clip going over the top of my ear causing discomfort 0 
best headset ever 1 
but it is great i would really recommend it 1 
i like the fact that it rests lightly against your ear rather than inside 1 
a lot of websites have been rating this a very good phone and so do i 1 
this is the phone to get for 2005 i just bought my s710a and all i can say is wow 1 
just reading on the specs alone makes you say wow 1 
love it great armband 1 
also makes it easier to hold on to 1 
beautiful styling though 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
lousy product 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the songs were the best and the muppets were so hilarious 1 
i can think of no other film where something vitally important occurs every other minute 1 
in other words the content level of this film is enough to easily fill a dozen other films 1 
this short film certainly pulls no punches 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
long whiny and pointless 0 
totally believable 1 
i sat riveted to the tv screen 1 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
this if the first movie ive given a 10 to in years 1 
overall the film is interesting and thoughtprovoking 1 
i dont think you will be disappointed 1 
but in terms of the writing its very fresh and bold 1 
and sometimes it was so embarrassing that i had to look away 0 
the scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace 0 
i really liked that 1 
a great film by a great director 1 
1010 1 
i liked this movie way too much 1 
however this didnt make up for the fact that overall this was a tremendously boring movie 0 
i could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing iq 0 
i saw mirrormask last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience 0 
this is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
also its a real treat to see anthony quinn playing crazy horse 1 
it was so boring 0 
horrible 0 
worst hour and a half of my lifeoh my gosh 0 
there is no plot or storyline 0 
it was a good thing that the tickets only cost five dollars because i would be mad if id have paid 750 to see this crap 0 
this movie now joins revenge of the boogeyman and zombiez as part of the hellish trinity of horror films 0 
everything is appalling 0 
artless camerawork endlessly presents us with the ugliest setting imaginable ie 0 
it probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy 0 
ray charles life provided excellent biographical material for the film which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician 1 
the poor actors 0 
the dialogue sucked 0 
that was funny 1 
it was so funny 1 
he is one of my favourite directors and one of the most talented directors in the history of cinema 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
his performance as awarded was stunning 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the telephone repair man was really funny and his reactions to the nuts and bitchy boss were truly genuine 1 
the malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue 0 
to call this movie a drama is ridiculous 0 
didnt laugh or even smile once 0 
but it wasnt anything at all just one big yawn 0 
barney is definitely super de duper 1 
but storm trooper is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
definitely worth checking out 1 
it didnt make me scared horrified or make me sympathetic towards the characters it was simply annoying 0 
god and i can never get that 90 minutes back 0 
i think the most wonderful parts literally full of wonder are the excerpts from his works 1 
they could be used as exemplars for any set designer 1 
i highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art poetry theater politics or japanese history 1 
though the wind and the lion is told largely through the eyes of the son every member of the family can identify with one of the characters whether it be sean connerys noble brigand candace bergens feisty heroine john hustons wily john hay or steve kanalys spiffy radiant ruthless cando lieutenant roosevelts big stick 1 
not too screamy not to masculine but just right 1 
even worse than ticker 0 
i just cant explain this movie more than romanticcharminghilariousand adorablethe junkyard scenes are funnyall the junkyard dogs have something specialtoo funny i laughedkids will love itbuy it when it comes outit has new features 1 
now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant american propaganda 0 
i hate writing bad reviews about films especially those in which i really like the star but this film is so bad i dont believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it 0 
it came free with a dvd player i bought but i still turned the thing off halfway through because i was embarrassed for howell 0 
but the actingeven that of such professionals as drago and debbie rochonwas terrible the directing worse perhaps contributory to the former the dialog chimplike and the camera work barely tolerable 0 
i like armand assante my cable companys summary sounded interesting so i watched it twice already and probably will again 1 
i believe the screenwriter did a good job of tying up the loose ends 1 
considering the relations off screen between taylor and stanwyck it was surprising how little chemistry there was on screen between the two of them 0 
even the squibs look awful 0 
this movie contained an allstar cast and what i loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who i havent seen before 1 
this movie was kind of long in length but i enjoyed every minute of it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
20th century foxs road house 1948 is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie 0 
and if that isnt enough of a mess of a movie for you the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors 0 
add betty white and jean smart and you have a great cast everyone played their parts really well 1 
putting the race card aside lets look at the major flaw in the film they destroy latifas character 0 
both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable 0 
not recommended 0 
i understand that its supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy but that doesnt mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive 0 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
being a 90s child i truly enjoyed this show and i can proudly say that i enjoyed it big time and even more than the classical wb cartoons 1 
easily none other cartoon made me laugh in a tender way before getting into dark sitcoms oriented for teenagers 1 
there is simply no excuse for something this poorly done 0 
i saw this movie and i thought this is a stupid movie 0 
what is even more stupid is that who had thought an idea that there should be a volcano in los angeles 0 
the story line is just awful 0 
my rating just 3 out of 10 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
he really didnt seem to want to be hosting his voiceovers were monotonous didnt get involved with the guests 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
its a campy sort of film thats a joy to watch 1 
i believe every one should see this movie as i think few people outside of south africa understand its past and what is being attempted in the truth and reconciliation process 1 
the acting is fantastic the stories are seamlessly woven together and the dogs are splendid a must rent view or see 1 
excellent performance 1 
if you do watch it however there are small consolations the actresses playing annes sisters each do a wonderful job with their roles 1 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
this is definitely one of the better documentaries i have seen looking at family relationships and marriage 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
its a mediocre miserable hollow laughable and predictable piece of garbage 0 
the results well are a shame 0 
the stories were as unbelievable as the actors 0 
the attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eyepleasing gem 1 
top line dont waste your time and money on this one its as bad as it comes 0 
its an empty hollow shell of a movie 0 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
it is rare when a filmmaker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesnt fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent 1 
you wont forget this movie 1 
this is an extraordinary film 1 
you will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars 1 
mark my words this is one of those cult films like evil dead 2 or phantasm that people will still be discovering and falling in love with 20 30 40 years down the line 1 
see it with your kids if you have a chanceit will open up some amazing dialog about how far race relations have come in the last 50 years 1 
very disappointed and wondered how it could be in the oscar shortlist 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
great character actors telly savalas and peter boyle 1 
now imagine that every single one of those decisions was made wrong 0 
worse theres an incredibly weak subplot thrown in that follows a little band of latterday mansonites as they go after a reporter whos working on a story on the anniversary of the killings 0 
a film not easily forgotten 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
dee snider just plain sucks 0 
the story is lame not interesting and never really explains the sinister origins of the puppets 0 
the best part about nurse betty is its unpredictability 1 
otherwise dont even waste your time on this 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i didnt realize how wonderful the short really is until the last two scenes 1 
characters are onedimensional even the good guys and especially the bad guys 0 
not much dialogue not much music the whole film was shot as elaborately and aesthetically like a sculpture 1 
funny clever hip just like prays previous film hype 1 
it never condescends all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems 1 
however after finally watching this film i realized that not only had i had a closed mind to the brilliance it depicts i also found myself watching it over and over again 1 
its the one movie that never ceases to interest me simply because it keeps me alert as i try to attempt to decipher its meanings 1 
it presents a idyllic yet serious portrayal of the ups and downs of the characters lives 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
it showed exactly how the government and the scientist argued for humanity and the reasons of the gadget 1 
hayao miyazakis latest and eighth film for studio ghibili gake no ue no ponyo ponyo on the cliff by the sea is a wonderfully fun and imaginative look at childhood 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
fans of the genre will be in heaven 1 
unfortunately any virtue in this films production work was lost on a regrettable script 0 
exceptionally bad 0 
not tasty and the texture was just nasty 0 
i was shocked because no signs indicate cash only 0 
this hole in the wall has great mexican street tacos and friendly staff 1 
took an hour to get our food only 4 tables in restaurant my food was luke warm our sever was running around like he was totally overwhelmed 0 
frozen pucks of disgust with some of the worst people behind the register 0 
the only thing i did like was the prime rib and dessert section 1 
my side greek salad with the greek dressing was so tasty and the pita and hummus was very refreshing 1 
at least think to refill my water before i struggle to wave you over for 10 minutes 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
dont do it 0 
my husband and i ate lunch here and were very disappointed with the food and service 0 
i give it 2 thumbs down 0 
this is a great restaurant at the mandalay bay 1 
delicious 1 
we also ordered the spinach and avocado salad the ingredients were sad and the dressing literally had zero taste 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
food was great and so was the serivce 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it was either too cold not enough flavor or just bad 0 
if it were possible to give them zero stars theyd have it 0 
drinks took close to 30 minutes to come out at one point 0 
now the pizza itself was good the peanut sauce was very tasty 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i as well wouldve given godfathers zero stars if possible 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the restaurant atmosphere was exquisite 1 
you cant go wrong with any of the food here 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
we waited an hour for what was a breakfast i could have done 100 times better at home 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
the food was very good 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the bus boy on the other hand was so rude 0 
back to good bbq lighter fare reasonable pricing and tell the public they are back to the old ways 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
they could serve it with just the vinaigrette and it may make for a better overall dish but it was still very good 1 
we had fantastic service and were pleased by the atmosphere 1 
5 stars for the brick oven bread app 1 
i have eaten here multiple times and each time the food was delicious 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
on the good side the staff was genuinely pleasant and enthusiastic a real treat 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
as always the evening was wonderful and the food delicious 1 
the staff are great the ambiance is great 1 
he deserves 5 stars 1 
i took back my money and got outta there 0 
the food was terrible 0 
this is a disgrace 0 
def coming back to bowl next time 1 
service is perfect and the family atmosphere is nice to see 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i dont have to be an accountant to know im getting screwed 0 
left very frustrated 0 
ill definitely be in soon again 1 
on the ground right next to our table was a large smeared beensteppedinandtrackedeverywhere pile of green bird poop 0 
strike 2 who wants to be rushed 0 
it was a huge awkward 15lb piece of cow that was 34ths gristle and fat 0 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
it was attached to a gas station and that is rarely a good sign 0 
the menu had so much good stuff on it i could not decide 1 
the pancake was also really good and pretty large at that 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
their monster chicken fried steak and eggs is my all time favorite 1 
i would not recommend this place 0 
if you havent gone here go now 1 
similarly the delivery man did not say a word of apology when our food was 45 minutes late 0 
the bartender was also nice 1 
an excellent new restaurant by an experienced frenchman 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i believe that this place is a great stop for those with a huge belly and hankering for sushi 1 
i will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
the croutons also taste homemade which is an extra plus 1 
not good for the money 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it was awesome 1 
the chicken i got was definitely reheated and was only ok the wedges were cold and soggy 0 
very disappointing 0 
the grilled chicken was so tender and yellow from the saffron seasoning 1 
i was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar not only because the quality is great but the service is fast and the food impeccable 1 
food was average at best 0 
great food 1 
that just screams legit in my booksomethats also pretty rare here in vegas 1 
i promise they wont disappoint 1 
the plantains were the worst ive ever tasted 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
will definitely be back 1 
needless to say we will never be back here again 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
only pros large seating area nice bar area great simple drink menu the best brick oven pizza with homemade dough 1 
cute quaint simple honest 1 
ryans bar is definitely one edinburgh establishment i wont be revisiting 0 
friends pasta also bad he barely touched it 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
im not sure how long we stood there but it was long enough for me to begin to feel awkwardly out of place 0 
an extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast 1 
i always order from the vegetarian menu during dinner which has a wide array of options to choose from 1 
i got to enjoy the seafood salad with a fabulous vinegrette 1 
when im on this side of town this will definitely be a spot ill hit up again 1 
but the service was beyond bad 0 
im so happy to be here 1 
tasted like dirt 0 
the food is not tasty at all not to say its real traditional hunan style 0 
so in a nutshell 1 the restaraunt smells like a combination of a dirty fish market and a sewer 0 
so good i am going to have to review this place twice once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night 1 
why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked 0 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
i love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes 1 
food quality has been horrible 0 
the price is reasonable and the service is great 1 
talk about great customer service of course we will be back 1 
for sushi on the strip this is the place to go 1 
all in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service a unique menu and a beautiful setting 1 
there was hardly any meat 0 
i found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa 0 
i had strawberry tea which was good 1 
highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
i could barely stomach the meal but didnt complain because it was a business lunch 0 
the meat was pretty dry i had the sliced brisket and pulled pork 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
but i dont like it 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
food was below average 0 
it sure does beat the nachos at the movies but i would expect a little bit more coming from a restaurant 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the presentation of the food was awful 0
