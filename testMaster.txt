great for the jawbone 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the design is very odd as the ear clip is not very comfortable at all 0 
it clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this case seems well made 1 
i have been very happy with the 510 and have had no complaints from any one regarding my sound quality on their end 1 
mic doesnt work 0 
great choice 1 
do not buy for d807wrongly advertised for d807 0 
i purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working 0 
im very disappointed with my decision 0 
prosgood camera very nice pictures also has cool styles like black and white and more 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case 1 
gets the job done 1 
great audio 1 
ive only had my bluetooth for a few weeks but i really like it 1 
the majority of the logitech earbud headsets failed 0 
thank you for wasting my money 0 
the igo chargers and tips are really great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the color is even prettier than i thought it would be and the graphics are incredibly sharp 1 
the best electronics of the available fm transmitters 1 
great headset very impressed h500 1 
good transmit audio 1 
we are sending it back 0 
im a bit disappointed 0 
really pleased with this product so far 1 
one of my favorite purchases ever 1 
i was very excited to get this headset because i thought it was really cute 1 
big disappointment with calendar sync 0 
its fits like a glove and is strong secure and durable 1 
o my gosh the best phone i have ever had 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this product had a strong rubberpetroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it 0 
the cable looks so thin and flimsy it is scary 0 
returned 8 hours later 0 
love this headset 1 
worked perfectly 1 
great phone 1 
now i know that i made a wise decision 1 
i was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem 1 
good item low price 1 
the plug did not work very well 0 
very comfortable 1 
ive dropped my phone more times than i can say even on concrete and my phone is still great knock on wood 1 
i was sitting in my vehicle with the cradle on my belt and the headset lost signal 0 
comfortable nice range good battery life 1 
awesome device 1 
love this phone 1 
great hands free device 1 
after trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well 1 
poor sound quality 0 
the company shipped my product very promptly and it works well 1 
better than youd expect 1 
very prompt service 1 
we received a white colored battery that goes dead after a couple hoursthe original used to last a week but still lasts longer than thereplacement 0 
i even fully charged it before i went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wifi and noticed that it only had 20 left in the morning 0 
disappointed 0 
poor voice clarity 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the update procedure is difficult and cumbersome 0 
disappointment i hate anything that goes in my ear 0 
verizons bills however are difficult to understand even though their pricing plans are simple 0 
this frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching 1 
keep up the good work amazon 1 
perhaps my phone is defective but people cannot hear me when i use this 0 
i own a jabra earset and was very happy with it but the sound quality especially outgoing on this is better 1 
great product for the price 1 
i can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying what 0 
it does everything the description said it would 1 
it feels poorly constructed the menus are difficult to navigate and the buttons are so recessed that it is difficult to push them 0 
this is a great phone 1 
it is cheap and it feel and look just as cheap 0 
i like design and look of jabra behing the ear headsets and 5020 is pretty comfortible to wear 24 hours a day without pain in the ear 1 
however i needed some better instructions 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
dont bother go to the store 0 
obviously they have a terrible customer service so you get what you pay for 0 
i contacted the company and they told me that although the unit was still under warranty if i couldnt produce my receipt i was out of luck 0 
when i placed my treo into the case not only was it not snug but there was a lot of extra room on the sides 0 
i found the product to be easy to set up and use 1 
this does not fit the palm tungsten e2 and it broke the first time i tried to plug it in 0 
i love the look and feel of samsung flipphones 1 
cant upload ringtones from a third party 0 
the volume for the ringer is real good you have choices how loud 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
chinese forgeries abound 0 
the nokia ca42 usb cable did not work with my phone 0 
the design might be ergonomic in theory but i could not stand having these in my ear 0 
it doesnt make you look cool 0 
comfortable fit you need your headset to be comfortable for at least an hour at a time if not for an entire day 1 
so just beware 0 
good value works fine power via usb car or wall outlet 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
cheap but hey it works was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item 1 
its the best headset i have used 1 
i get absolutely horrible reception in my apartment where with other phones i have not had this problem 0 
this is a great deal 1 
it was horrible 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
perfect for the ps3 1 
good works fine 1 
for the price this was a great deal 1 
the jabra eargels fit my ears very well 1 
i checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing 0 
product is exactly as described 1 
however the ear pads come off easily and after only one week i lost one 0 
poor reliability 0 
if i take a picture the battery drops a bar and starts beeping letting me know its dieing 0 
it was a waste of my money 0 
would recommend this item 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
just really good so far probably the best bt headset i have ever had 1 
i was very pleased to see that i could replace my well travled swivel holster for my blackberry flip 1 
the bottowm lineanother worthless cheap gimmick from sprint 0 
when it opens the battery connection is broken and the device is turned off 0 
it was that loudglad to say that the plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use 1 
the speaker is of low quality so as making the ring tones sound very cheap 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it 0 
works for me 1 
it looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i have had mine for about a year and this christmas i bought some for the rest of the family 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
however the keypads are so tinny that i sometimes reach the wrong buttons 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
excellent product 1 
adapter does not provide enough charging current 0 
painful on the ear 0 
the screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face 0 
item does not match picture 0 
attempting artiness with black white and clever camera angles the movie disappointed became even more ridiculous as the acting was poor and the plot and lines almost nonexistent 0 
the best scene in the movie was when gerardo is trying to find a song that keeps running through his head 1 
the movie showed a lot of florida at its best made it look very appealing 1 
its quite simply the highest most superlative form of cinema imaginable 1 
this game rocks 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i wasnt the least bit interested 0 
the film succeeds despite or perhaps because of an obviously meagre budget 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
there is a totally unnecessary trainroller coaster scene 0 
this movie totally grates on my nerves 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the movie was so boring that i sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a columbo movie before 0 
i really liked that 1 
brilliant 1 
there were several moments in the movie that just didnt need to be there and were excruciatingly slow moving 0 
unfortunately inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict 0 
all the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core 0 
i paid too much 0 
still i do like this movie for its empowerment of women theres not enough movies out there like this one 1 
i mean this in a terrible way 0 
not a pleasant voyage of selfdiscovery 0 
yes its that bad 0 
this movie suffered because of the writing it needed more suspense 0 
there were too many close ups 0 
hence the whole story lacks a certain energy 0 
do not waste your time 0 
this would not even be good as a made for tv flick 0 
the film has great actors a master director a significant themeat least a wouldbe significant theme undertone of fifties existential worldweariness aerial scenes that ought to have thrilled both senses and imagination and characters about which one might deeply care 1 
unfortunately this is a bad movie that is just plain bad 0 
that was funny 1 
spoilers whatever else can or cant be said about it surface is superbly crafted 1 
all things considered a job very well done 1 
up there with the best of melville 1 
when i saw it in the theater i thought i was going to be sick 0 
kieslowski never ceases to amaze me 1 
his use of the colours of the french flag in the three films was nothing short of incredible every shot every scene was like a work of art 1 
i have to mention this and it is a huge spoiler i loved the ending how all the characters of the three films were the remaining survivors of the ferry disaster with valentine and the young judge together and the old man watching it on her tv solidifying his happiness over the suffering which he dealt with for those many years 1 
i couldnt think of a better way to end the film but a smile on my face great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy 1 
this is actually a very smart movie 1 
the ending is so so perfect youll shed a tear 1 
which has more depth and character than the man underneath it 0 
it was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that i was watching play rather than a film 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old 1 
even if you love bad movies do not watch this movie 0 
everything from acting to cinematography was solid 1 
definitely worth checking out 1 
the jerky camera movements were also annoying 0 
the most annoying thing about cover girl is the way in which rita hayworth is put up on a pedestal 0 
unfortunately cover girl is an example of how hollywood used to exploit women for financial gain 0 
nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well 1 
a world better than 95 of the garbage in the theatres today 1 
her role was played well 1 
that movie was bad 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the plot doesnt hang together at all and the acting is absolutely appalling 0 
not even good for camp value 0 
this film and i use that word loosely is an insult to the moviegoing public 0 
the death row scenes were entirely unmoving 0 
i knew when i saw the film that more great things were to come from this gifted actor 1 
even the squibs look awful 0 
overall i rate this movie a 10 out of a 110 scale 1 
i found this move beautiful enjoyable and uplifting 1 
duris has a wholesome appearance and gives a fine performance 1 
but the movie makes a lot of serious mistakes 0 
there is no real plot 0 
its just adorable seeing mickey playing turkey in the straw in a highly imaginative if occasionally cruel way 1 
im terribly disappointed that this film would receive so many awards and accolades especially when there are far more deserving works of film out there 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
its a shame to see good actors like thomerson and james make a living in a mess like this 0 
i thought it was bad 0 
the best example of how dumb the writing is when its established that you can turn the zombiestudents back into humans by removing a necklace containing a piece of the meteorite 0 
director paul matthews who also wrotedirected the weak 1995 monster movie grim clearly doesnt know how to pace his films 0 
the films sole bright spot was jonah hill who will look almost unrecognizable to fans of the recent superbad due to the amount of weight he lost in the interim 1 
with the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer 0 
filmiing was less expansive 0 
not recommended 0 
even when the women finally show up there is no sign of improvement the most expected things happen and by the time the film is over you might be far asleep 0 
every element of this story was so over the top excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through 0 
this is a masterful piece of filmmaking with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poets bohemian selfindulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of london and the outward tranquillity of a welsh coastal retreat the borderlines between friendship lust and love dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns jealousy rivalry cowardice and egotism versus heroism and selfsacrifice and more 1 
but above all the exquisite visual composition of each moment with inventive and elegant use of closeup camera angle and lighting including pointillistic faux home movie footage is a wonder and joy to behold 1 
i thought errol flynn was brilliant as custer and has since become my favourite actor 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
there still are good actors around 1 
unless youre just out to visually collect all extant films of austens work you can skip this one 0 
raw and sublimely moving 1 
it was also the right balance of war and love 1 
the film gives meaning to the phrase never in the history of human conflict has so much been owed by so many to so few 1 
there are many continuity errors one other user commented on different cars in the garage joes glassesthe one that got to me the most was the fact joes facial hair configuration seemed to change from scene to scene 0 
i cant see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection 0 
this is one of peter watkins most accessible films 1 
very bad performance plays angela bennett a computer expert who is at home all the time 0 
never heard of any of them except cole who was totally unbelievable in the part 0 
lame would be the best way to describe it 0 
emily watsons character is very strong and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything 1 
in fact i liked it better than interview with a vampire and i liked this lestat stuart townsend better than cruises attempt 1 
aailiyah was pretty good as akasha in places compelling her first entrance and mini dance scene 1 
im a big fan of this series mostly due to anne rices style sensitivities and treatments 1 
a very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart 1 
this early film from future goremeister lucio fulci is a very good addition to the giallo subgenre 1 
its still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema 1 
and it was boring 0 
ps the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up 1 
an italian reviewer called this a small great film and thats right 1 
the film is well paced understated and one of the best courtroom documentaries ive seen 1 
star trek v the final frontier is the worst in the series 0 
its pretty surprising that this wonderful film was made in 1949 as hollywood generally had its collective heads in the sand concerning black and white issues at that time 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
im still trying to get over how bad it was 0 
this movie is possibly one of the most creative works of horror ever 1 
everything stinks 0 
in short dont bother with this movie 0 
the scripting of the subtle comedy is unmatched by any movie in recent years 1 
at around 4 pm i bought it at around 8pm i started to watch at around 815pm i fast forwarded the remaining film to see if there was anything left watchable for a human being with a brain but there wasnt 0 
then theres the plot holes 0 
you could drive a semi truck into these holes 0 
a piece of cinematic garbage captured on celluloid 0 
avoid at any and all costs 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
its one of the most boring horror movies from the 90s mainly because it starts slow and centers in a boring atmosphere 0 
the puppets look really cheesy not in a good way like in the puppet master 80s flicks 0 
the fact is this film is a wonderful heartwarming tale about two people chasing their dreams 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
excellent short film 1 
i agree with jessica this movie is pretty bad 0 
for readers who have already seen one of miyazakis films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience 1 
the two main characters may be two of the most believable children i ever saw put on screen 1 
its too bad that everyone else involved didnt share crowes level of dedication to quality for if they did wed have a far better film on our hands than this subpar mess 0 
i was particularly pleased with the acting ability of dwight schultz 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow 1 
anyway the plot flowed smoothly and the malebonding scenes were a hoot 1 
the opening sequence of this gem is a classic and the cat n mouse games that follow are a delight to watch 1 
it looked like a wonderful story 1 
the only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive 1 
the shrimp tender and moist 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i love the pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try 1 
the only good thing was our waiter he was very helpful and kept the bloddy marys coming 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
sooooo good 1 
this is a really fantastic thai restaurant which is definitely worth a visit 1 
i just dont know how this place managed to served the blandest food i have ever eaten when they are preparing indian cuisine 0 
and the red curry had so much bamboo shoots and wasnt very tasty to me 0 
we watched our waiter pay a lot more attention to other tables and ignore us 0 
their menu is diverse and reasonably priced 1 
delicious 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
lordy the khao soi is a dish that is not to be missed for curry lovers 1 
the service here leaves a lot to be desired 0 
the atmosphere is modern and hip while maintaining a touch of coziness 1 
not a weekly haunt but definitely a place to come back to every once in a while 1 
the best place to go for a tasty bowl of pho 1 
it is worth the drive 1 
i had heard good things about this place but it exceeding every hope i could have dreamed of 1 
wont go back 0 
horrible dont waste your time and money 0 
waited 2 hours never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did 0 
just dont know why they were so slow 0 
i live in the neighborhood so i am disappointed i wont be back here because it is a convenient location 0 
i love the fact that everything on their menu is worth it 1 
she ordered a toasted english muffin that came out untoasted 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and considering the two of us left there very full and happy for about 20 you just cant go wrong 1 
favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma 1 
great service and food 1 
there is nothing authentic about this place 0 
of all the dishes the salmon was the best but all were great 1 
pretty good beer selection too 1 
we sat another ten minutes and finally gave up and left 0 
it shouldnt take 30 min for pancakes and eggs 0 
best fish ive ever had in my life 1 
the bathroom is just next door and very nice 1 
this is an outstanding little restaurant with some of the best food i have ever tasted 1 
pretty cool i would say 1 
in an interesting part of town this place is amazing 1 
will never ever go back and have told many people what had happened 0 
i dont recommend unless your car breaks down in front of it and you are starving 0 
if you want healthy authentic or ethic food try this place 1 
i dont know what kind it is but they have the best iced tea 1 
i really enjoyed eating here 1 
wow very spicy but delicious 1 
if youre not familiar check it out 1 
id love to go back 1 
not to mention the combination of pears almonds and bacon is a big winner 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the chicken wings contained the driest chicken meat i have ever eaten 0 
we loved the place 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
we enjoy their pizza and brunch 1 
id rather eat airline food seriously 0 
the waitress and manager are so friendly 1 
by far the best cheesecurds we have ever had 1 
at first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe nice ambiance clean friendly staff 1 
point your finger at any item on the menu order it and you wont be disappointed 1 
first time there and might just be the last 0 
the yellowtail carpaccio was melt in your mouth fresh 1 
last night was my second time dining here and i was so happy i decided to go back 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
an hour seriously 0 
eew this location needs a complete overhaul 0 
waited and waited and waited 0 
it was a pale color instead of nice and char and has no flavor 0 
good value great food great service 1 
i had the chicken pho and it tasted very bland 0 
a drive thru means you do not want to wait around for half an hour for your food but somehow when we end up going here they make us wait and wait 0 
best of luck to the rude and noncustomer service focused new management 0 
four stars for the food the guy in the blue shirt for his great vibe still letting us in to eat 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
maybe if they werent cold they would have been somewhat edible 0 
we wont be going back anytime soon 0 
very convenient since we were staying at the mgm 1 
eclectic selection 1 
as a sushi lover avoid this place by all means 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
went for lunch service was slow 0 
anyways the food was definitely not filling at all and for the price you pay you should expect more 0 
the cashier was friendly and even brought the food out to me 1 
2 thumbs up 1 
if you are reading this please dont go there 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
try them in the airport to experience some tasty food and speedy friendly service 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
will not be back 0 
there was a warm feeling with the service and i felt like their guest for a special treat 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the jalapeno bacon is soooo good 1 
my girlfriends veal was very bad 0 
bland and flavorless is a good way of describing the barely tepid meat 0 
great atmosphere friendly and fast service 1 
i had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill but unfortunately the taste fell flat way flat 0 
i could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine 1 
the server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome i would not suggest this place 0 
no one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it 0 
best service and food ever maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day 1 
they were excellent 1 
i recently tried caballeros and i have been back every week since 1 
this place deserves no stars 0 
my fella got the huevos rancheros and they didnt look too appealing 0 
weird vibe from owners 0 
i love the ownerchef his one authentic japanese cool dude 1 
now the burgers arent as good the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless 0 
i want to first say our server was great and we had perfect service 1 
the pizza selections are good 1 
spend your money elsewhere 0 
this is my new fav vegas buffet spot 1 
they brought a fresh batch of fries and i was thinking yay something warm but no 0 
this place is disgusting 0 
the place was fairly clean but the food simply wasnt worth it 0 
dont bother coming here 0 
probably not in a hurry to go back 0 
my husband said she was very rude did not even apologize for the bad food or anything 0 
after all the rave reviews i couldnt wait to eat herewhat a disappointment 0 
hell no will i go back 0 
weve have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i vomited in the bathroom mid lunch 0 
i have been to very few places to eat that under no circumstances would i ever return to and this tops the list 0 
food was below average 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the refried beans that came with my meal were dried out and crusty and the food was bland 0
