If you have several dozen or several hundred contacts, then imagine the fun of sending each of them one by one.	0
He was very impressed when going from the original battery to the extended battery.	1
The commercials are the most misleading.	0
Great Pocket PC / phone combination.	1
That's a huge design flaw (unless I'm not using it correctly, which I don't think is the case).	0
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.	1
It is very comfortable on the ear.	1
Bad Quality.	0
it did not work in my cell phone plug i am very up set with the charger!.	0
Very good stuff for the price.	1

If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
fast service.	1

It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.	0
What a big waste of time.	0
Great sound and service.	1
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.	0
Worst Customer Service Ever.	0
Excellent wallet type phone case.	1
It is very comfortable to wear as well, which is probably the most important aspect about using a case.	1
Great for using with your home stereo.	1
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.	1
Not only will it drain your player, but may also potentially fry it.	0
Worked perfectly!	1
Great phone!.	1
Don't buy it.	0
Works great, when my cat attacked the phone he scratched the protective strip instead of destroying the screen.	1
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.	1
However-the riingtones are not the best, and neither are the games.	0
VERY comfortable.	1
The microphone also works well, but (according to people I have called) it applifies everything.	1
Soyo technology sucks.	0
Same problem as others have mentioned.	0
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.	0
Sounds good reasonably priced and effective, Its that simple !	1
Works great.	1
We received a WHITE colored battery that goes DEAD after a couple hoursTHe original used to last a week - but still lasts longer than thereplacement	0
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.	1
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.	0
IT'S REALLY EASY.	1
Low Quality.	0
I might have gotten a defect, but I would not risk buying it again because of the built quality alone.	0
i'm glad i found this product on amazon it is hard to find, it wasn't high priced.	1
Portable and it works.	1
We would recommend these to others.	1
Disappointed!.	0
poor voice clarity.	0

I had Verizon 2 years ago and really liked their service.	1
Bad Purchase.	0
I would have given no star if I was able.	0
I would not recommend this item to anyone.	0
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.	1
I am very impressed with the job that Motorola did on the sturdiness of this phone.	1
I received my orders well within the shipping timeframe, everything was in good working order and overall, I am very excited to have this source.	1
I ended up sliding it on the edge of my pants or back pockets instead.	1
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.	0
Don't buy this product.	0
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.	0
I own a Jabra Earset and was very happy with it, but the sound quality, especially outgoing, on this is better.	1
I love the camera, it's really pretty good quality.	1
Its a total package.	1
Cumbersome design.	0
It works great with a car charger, especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time.	1
It plays louder than any other speaker of this size; the price is so low that most would think the quality is lacking, however, it's not.	1
I got the car charger and not even after a week the charger was broken...I went to plug it in and it started smoking.	0
Better Than New.	1
A pretty good product.	1
This is a great phone!.	1
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.	1
Those phones are working just fine now.	1
This is infuriating.	0
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.	1
This does not fit the Palm Tungsten E2 and it broke the first time I tried to plug it in.	0
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.	0
It quit working after I'd used it for about 18 months, so I just purchased another one because this is the best headset I've ever owned.	1
Unfortunately it will not recharge my iPhone 4s, despite connecting it from multiple power sources (iMac, external battery, wall outlet, etc).	0
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!	0
This product is great... it makes working a lot easier I can go to the copier while waiting on hold for something.	1
T-Mobile has the best customer service anywhere.	1
The design is very good.4.	1
Couldn't use the unit with sunglasses, not good in Texas!	0
If you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations, then this phone is for you!	0
WORTHWHILE.	1
It is simple to use and I like it.	1
I bought this battery with a coupon from Amazon and I'm very happy with my purchase.	1
At first I thought I was grtting a good deal at $7.44, until I plugged it into my phone (V3c Razr).	0
Product is exactly as described.	1
It would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with Amazon.	0
Used and dirty.	0
Very unreliable service from T-mobile !	0
These products cover up the important light sensor above the ear outlet.	0

Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.	1
Works for me.	1
Saggy, floppy piece of junk.	0
Works good.	1
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.	1
but it is great, i would really recommend it	1
You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off."	1
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.	1
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.	1
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.	1
Buttons are too small.	0
This company charge me a restocking fee and still not given me my refund back.	0
Earbud piece breaks easily.	0
Echo Problem....Very unsatisfactory	0
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.	0
Item Does Not Match Picture.	0
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).	0
Wasted two hours.  	0
The movie showed a lot of Florida at it's best, made it look very appealing.  	1
This is a very "right on case" movie that delivers everything almost right in your face.  	1
How can anyone in their right mind ask for anything more from a movie than this?  	1
It's PURE BRILLIANCE.  	1
But even the talented Carrell can't save this.  	0
It's hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl.  	1
I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little.  	1
The suspense builders were good, & just cross the line from G to PG.  	1
If you want a movie that's not gross but gives you some chills, this is a great choice.  	1
Alexander Nevsky is a great film.  	1
It is a true classic.  	1
It was horrendous.  	0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
Too politically correct.  	0
The music in the film is really nice too.  	1
This was a poor remake of "My Best Friends Wedding".  	0
All in all, a great disappointment.  	0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
IMDB ratings only go as low 1 for awful, it's time to get some negative numbers in there for cases such as these.  	0
Your brain will attempt to shut-down as part of a primal impulse of self-preservation.  	0
The lead man is charisma-free.  	0
I don't think I've ever seen a movie half as boring as this self-indulgent piece of junk.  	0
Ironically I mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch.  	0
There are the usual Hitchcock logic flaws.  	0
Mishima is extremely uninteresting.  	0
Woa, talk about awful.  	0
You can't even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action.  	0
No actress has been worse used that June Allison in this movie.  	0
Yet, I enjoy watching it.  	1
The concert sequences just sucked.  	0
It was so funny.  	1
One of the best mexican movies ever!, and one of the less understood, even by mexican themselves, no matter how identified the should have felt with it.  	1
Up there with the best of Melville.  	1
Everything about this film is simply incredible.  	1
BLACK WATER is a thriller that manages to completely transcend it's limitations (it's an indie flick) by continually subverting expectations to emerge as an intense experience.  	1
Really bad.  	0
Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  	0
Rating: 1 out of 10.  	0
I couldn't think of a better way to end the film, but a smile on my face, great way to wrap up an amazing film and trilogy!  	1
his performance, as awarded, was stunning.  	1
But when someone strives for greatness and poetry, but delivers a muddled (and often ridiculous) story, a bunch of disparate scenes, pretentious dialogue... Then you get the worst kind of a movie that some other reviewer very accurately defined as "pretentious crap".  	0
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
This movie is terrible.  	0
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
Damian is so talented and versatile in so many ways of writing and portraying different Characters on screen.  	1
I am so pleased to know such a modern day genius is out there , letting is passion for Art drive him and taking us as an audience with him.  	1
Lucy Bell is so much higher than this crap and for her to sink this low is quite depressing.  	0
I highly recommend this movie for anyone interested in art, poetry, theater, politics, or Japanese history.  	1
(My mother and brother had to do this)When I saw Robert Ryan portraying this type of man, it was a very good imitation of this type of individual, and I was impressed.  	1
It's a feel-good film and that's how I felt when I came out of the cinema!  	1
I liked it.  	1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
A world better than 95% of the garbage in the theatres today.  	1
I would have casted her in that role after ready the script.  	1
An interesting premise, and Billy Drago is always good as a dangerous nut-bag (side note: I'd love to see Drago, Stephen McHattie and Lance Hendrikson in a flick together; talk about raging cheekbones!).  	1
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
Not even good for camp value!  	0
If only someone involved with it knew how to string together narrative!  	0
Victor McLaglen was even bad, and Brian DonLevy was almost unrecognizable.  	0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0
The awful dialogue and hopeless overacting by everyone who gets shot top off a real waste of space and time.  	0
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
And, FINALLY, after all that, we get to an ending that would've been great had it been handled by competent people and not Jerry Falwell.  	0
This movie contained an all-star cast, and what I loved the most was that it opened my eyes to see other actors who I haven't seen before.  	1
This movie was kind of long in length, but I enjoyed every minute of it.  	1
And I forgot: The Casting here i superb, with Trond Fausa Aurvåg being perfect in the role as the Bothersome Man, who doesn't understand where he is, what he is doing and why.  	1
The entire audience applauded at the conclusion of the film.  	1
Cinematography noteworthy including fine views of Barcelona and its famed Gaudi towers.  	1
For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
Final Word: This Show is a real torture!!  	0
It is zillion times away from reality.  	0
And if that isn't enough of a mess of a movie for you - the picture is also marred with a constant use of studio sets and indoor exteriors.  	0
the cast was great.  	1
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
Clever and a real crowd-pleaser--this film still ranks among Mickey's best films even after 80 wonderful years.  	1
Director Paul Matthews, who also wrote/directed the weak 1995 monster movie "Grim", clearly doesn't know how to pace his films.  	0
This convention never worked well in the past, and certainly doesn't work here.  	0
The CG opening sequence in space looked like it could have been created on Microsoft Slideshow for God's sake!  	0
Gotta love those close-ups of slimy, drooling teeth!  	1
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  	0
He is almost unbearable to watch on screen, he has little to no charisma, and terrible comedic timing.  	0
Generally; it just lacked imagination.  	0
I can't believe there's even a sequel to this!  	0
The memories are murky but I can only say that I enjoyed every single episode and product related to the show.  	1
I saw this movie and I thought this is a stupid movie.  	0
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
Omit watching this.  	0
This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1
The basic premise is wasted since it is sidelined by the inexplicable focus on the documentary crew.  	0
I had always known that Errol Flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor, and I grew up watching his films as a child.  	1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
Excellently produced by one of Sci-fi's best producers Scot Vandiver !  	1
Nothing short of magnificent photography/cinematography in this film.  	1
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
Also great directing and photography.  	1
However Paul Schrader has indeed made a film "about" Mishima that is both superb & complex.  	1
Then the film just dropped the ball.  	0
Tom Wilkinson broke my heart at the end... and everyone else's judging by the amount of fumbling for hankies and hands going up to faces among males and females alike.  	1
A good film by a great director!  	1
It is a film about nothing, just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes.  	0
DELETE this film from your mind!  	0
Every time he opened his mouth you expect to hear, "you see kids..." Pulling the plug was a mercy killing for this horrible show.  	0
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
It will drive you barking mad!  	0
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  	1
What on earth is Irons doing in this film?  	0
I'm a big fan of this series mostly due to Anne Rice's style, sensitivities and treatments.  	1
I am so tired of clichés that is just lazy writing, and here they come in thick and fast.  	0
Why was this film made?  	0
The plot is nonsense that doesn't interest in the slightest way or have any uniqueness to it.  	0
This mostly routine fact-based TV drama gets a boost from the fine performance by Cole.  	1
It's very slow.  	0
Lot of holes in the plot: there's nothing about how he became the emperor; nothing about where he spend 20 years between his childhood and mature age.  	0
Lots of holes in the script.  	0
It's dumb and pointless, and a complete waste of time.  	0
I won't spoil it, but the ending in pretty amazing.  	1
If there was ever an indication of a writer and a director's ability to meld two highly volatile temperaments into a seamless union of creativity, then this is it!  	1
Linda Cardellini is the only thing good in this film.  	1
Avoid at any and all costs.  	0
At any rate this film stinks, its not funny, and Fulci should have stayed with giallo and supernatural zombie movies.  	0
Avoid this film at all costs.  	0
I felt asleep the first time I watched it, so I can recommend it for insomniacs.  	0
This one just fails to create any real suspense.  	0
I'm so sorry but I really can't recommend it to anyone.  	0
Funny, clever, hip - just like Pray's previous film, Hype!  	1
The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie.  	1
Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her character in "At Play In The Fields Of The Lord".  	1
It never condescends, all the characters have good genuine hearts and believable problems.  	1
Brilliance indeed.  	1
Just whatever you do, avoid "Groove" as its the antithesis of all that is good about Human Traffic.  	0
But it picked up speed and got right to the point.  	1
Both actors truly understand and become their particular character, delivering a convincing, sincere performance.  	1
Each track commands sentiment, actually contributing to the scenes and characters.  	1
Still, it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost.  	1
It is a very well acted and done TV Movie.  	1
Still it's quite interesting and entertaining to follow.  	1
:) Anyway, the plot flowed smoothly and the male-bonding scenes were a hoot.  	1
The cashier had no care what so ever on what I had to say it still ended up being wayyy overpriced.	0
So they performed.	1
- They never brought a salad we asked for.	0
If you want a sandwich just go to any Firehouse!!!!!	1
They have horrible attitudes towards customers, and talk down to each one when customers don't enjoy their food.	0
walked in and the place smelled like an old grease trap and only 2 others there eating.	0
I love the Pho and the spring rolls oh so yummy you have to try.	1
We'll never go again.	0
On the up side, their cafe serves really good food.	1
Check it out.	1
We thought you'd have to venture further away to get good sushi, but this place really hit the spot that night.	1
I wouldn't return.	0
Nice blanket of moz over top but i feel like this was done to cover up the subpar food.	1
I give it 2 thumbs down	0
Crostini that came with the salad was stale.	0
this was a different cut than the piece the other day but still wonderful and tender s well as well flavored.	1
I ordered the Voodoo pasta and it was the first time I'd had really excellent pasta since going gluten free several years ago.	1
I was seated immediately.	1
The waitresses are very friendly.	1
The burger had absolutely no flavor - the meat itself was totally bland, the burger was overcooked and there was no charcoal flavor.	0
I dressed up to be treated so rudely!	0
It was probably dirt.	0
The food sucked, which we expected but it sucked more than we could have imagined.	0
Interesting decor.	1
What I really like there is the crepe station.	1
Also were served hot bread and butter, and home made potato chips with bacon bits on top....very original and very good.	1
The live music on Fridays totally blows.	0
I've never been more insulted or felt disrespected.	0
Very friendly staff.	1
If that bug never showed up I would have given a 4 for sure, but on the other side of the wall where this bug was climbing was the kitchen.	0
My friend loved the salmon tartar.	1
Waitress was good though!	1
The folks at Otto always make us feel so welcome and special.	1
As for the "mains," also uninspired.	0
This wonderful experience made this place a must-stop whenever we are in town again.	1
Great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with TV's.	1
If she had not rolled the eyes we may have stayed... Not sure if we will go back and try it again.	0
like the other reviewer said "you couldn't pay me to eat at this place again."	0
Seriously flavorful delights, folks.	1
Based on the sub-par service I received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business I won't be going back.	0
They know how to make them here.	1
I hope this place sticks around.	1
The service was not up to par, either.	0
Thus far, have only visited twice and the food was absolutely delicious each time.	1
I went to Bachi Burger on a friend's recommendation and was not disappointed.	1
I waited and waited.	0
Waited 2 hours & never got either of our pizzas as many other around us who came in later did!	0
I didn't know pulled pork could be soooo delicious.	1
In the summer, you can dine in a charming outdoor patio - so very delightful.	1
Also, the fries are without a doubt the worst fries I've ever had.	0
Service was exceptional and food was a good as all the reviews.	1
Favorite place in town for shawarrrrrrma!!!!!!	1
The burger... I got the "Gold Standard" a $17 burger and was kind of disappointed.	0
the spaghetti is nothing special whatsoever.	0
Of all the dishes, the salmon was the best, but all were great.	1
It's worth driving up from Tucson!	1
The buffet is small and all the food they offered was BLAND.	0
Pretty cool I would say.	1
Definitely a turn off for me & i doubt I'll be back unless someone else is buying.	0
I find wasting food to be despicable, but this just wasn't food.	0
My wife had the Lobster Bisque soup which was lukewarm.	0
They will customize your order any way you'd like, my usual is Eggplant with Green Bean stir fry, love it!	1
And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.	0
RUDE & INCONSIDERATE MANAGEMENT.	0
This is a disgrace.	0
Overall, I was very disappointed with the quality of food at Bouchon.	0
Left very frustrated.	0
Food was really good and I got full petty fast.	1
I can assure you that you won't be disappointed.	1
Gave up trying to eat any of the crust (teeth still sore).	0
Wow very spicy but delicious.	1
I'll take my business dinner dollars elsewhere.	0
Not to mention the combination of pears, almonds and bacon is a big winner!	1
Best tater tots in the southwest.	1
The manager was the worst.	0
Total letdown, I would much rather just go to the Camelback Flower Shop and Cartel Coffee.	0
They had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and I liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle.	1
I would not recommend this place.	0
At first glance it is a lovely bakery cafe - nice ambiance, clean, friendly staff.	1
Anyway, I do not think i will go back there.	0
Point your finger at any item on the menu, order it and you won't be disappointed.	1
A greasy, unhealthy meal.	0
An excellent new restaurant by an experienced Frenchman.	1
Great steak, great sides, great wine, amazing desserts.	1
I *heart* this place.	1
I will never go back to this place and will never ever recommended this place to anyone!	0
The servers went back and forth several times, not even so much as an "Are you being helped?"	0
AN HOUR... seriously?	0
I consider this theft.	0
Our server was super nice and checked on us many times.	1
!....THE OWNERS REALLY REALLY need to quit being soooooo cheap let them wrap my freaking sandwich in two papers not one!	0
They really want to make your experience a good one.	1
Ordered burger rare came in we'll done.	0
I was proven dead wrong by this sushi bar, not only because the quality is great, but the service is fast and the food, impeccable.	1
I'm not eating here!	0
This place has a lot of promise but fails to deliver.	0
Both great!	1
It's a great place and I highly recommend it.	1
Service was slow and not attentive.	0
The decor is nice, and the piano music soundtrack is pleasant.	1
Anyways, The food was definitely not filling at all, and for the price you pay you should expect more.	0
Have been going since 2007 and every meal has been awesome!!	1
The atmosphere here is fun.	1
Not my thing.	0
A FLY was in my apple juice.. A FLY!!!!!!!!	0
Nicest Chinese restaurant I've been in a while.	1
An extensive menu provides lots of options for breakfast.	1
Great time - family dinner on a Sunday night.	1
Their frozen margaritas are WAY too sugary for my taste.	0
The chains, which I'm no fan of, beat this place easily.	0
So good I am going to have to review this place twice - once hereas a tribute to the place and once as a tribute to an event held here last night.	1
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered.	1
The service was terrible though.	0
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food.	0
The food came out at a good pace.	1
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting.	1
Highly unprofessional and rude to a loyal patron!	0
After the disappointing dinner we went elsewhere for dessert.	0
i felt insulted and disrespected, how could you talk and judge another human being like that?	0
I'm not impressed with the concept or the food.	0
The only thing I wasn't too crazy about was their guacamole as I don't like it puréed.	0
They brought a fresh batch of fries and I was thinking yay something warm but no!	0
Every time I eat here, I see caring teamwork to a professional degree.	1
However, there was so much garlic in the fondue, it was barely edible.	0
It was so bad, I had lost the heart to finish it.	0
This place lacked style!!	0
very slow at seating even with reservation.	0
The ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting, but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits.	0
Del Taco is pretty nasty and should be avoided if possible.	0
We've have gotten a much better service from the pizza place next door than the services we received from this restaurant.	0
Spend your money and time some place else.	0
I can't tell you how disappointed I was.	0
The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time.	0
