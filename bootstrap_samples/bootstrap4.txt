julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
never going back 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
worthwhile 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
crisp and clear 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
never going back 0 
works great 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
will not be back 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wont be back 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
not a good bargain 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place has it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
a bit predictable 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
very displeased 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
go and see it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
brilliant 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its a great item 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
will be back again 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
love it great armband 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
good transmit audio 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
how awesome is that 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
no real improvement 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
will order from them again 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
worst phone ever 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
omit watching this 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
its a great item 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
that was nice 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
excellent short film 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this place has it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great phone 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
dont do it 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
soggy and not good 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
great phone 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
love it great armband 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1

good servicecheck 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
good case 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i will not return 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
will be back again 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
dont do it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i will not return 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
warning do not buy 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this place has it 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i love it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
crisp and clear 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0
