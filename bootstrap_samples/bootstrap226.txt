this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0

the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
that was nice 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1

in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this place is great 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1

its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
service sucks 0

authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
great charger 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
worst phone ever 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
works great 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i love it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0

authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worthwhile 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
never going back 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
great phone 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great phone 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
good case 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this place is great 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
better than new 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great phone 1 
poor quality and service 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not enough volume 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great bluetooth 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great charger 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i want my money back 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
dont do it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0

their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
great pizza and salads 1

this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0

i love it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
will order from them again 1 
i will not return 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
service sucks 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
service sucks 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
love it great armband 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great bluetooth 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
brilliant 1 
go watch it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
warning do not buy 0

this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1

will order from them again 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
never going back 0 
cool phone 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
not a good bargain 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
go watch it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worthwhile 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i will not return 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
not my thing 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great movie 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i will not return 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the battery works great 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1

the film looks cheap and bland 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i wont be back 0 
good case 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
dont do it 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
worthwhile 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its a great item 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0
