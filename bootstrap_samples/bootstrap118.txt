i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
works great 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
good transmit audio 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
works great 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
not a good bargain 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
soggy and not good 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
will not be back 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
cool phone 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great phone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great charger 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the battery works great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
works great 1 
poor quality and service 0 
works great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
works great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
good case 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
go watch it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
will order from them again 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
will not be back 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the battery works great 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
that was nice 1 
cool phone 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i wont be back 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great charger 1 
poor quality and service 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
go and see it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i wont be back 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
service sucks 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0

great pizza and salads 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
service sucks 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
omit watching this 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
everything is appalling 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
poor quality and service 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
great phone 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great charger 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
worthwhile 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0

no buyers remorse on this one 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
works great 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0

its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
poor quality and service 0

the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

this place is great 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

great movie 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1
