the directing is sloppy at best 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
service sucks 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
go watch it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the battery works great 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent short film 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great phone 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
no real improvement 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
will be back again 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
excellent short film 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
that was nice 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
service sucks 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
no real improvement 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
last time buying from you 0 
brilliant 1 
never going back 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
service sucks 0 
that was nice 1 
a bit predictable 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
dont do it 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
omit watching this 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this place is great 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
not enough volume 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
service sucks 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0

display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
very displeased 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
service sucks 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
service sucks 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
not my thing 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great charger 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
warning do not buy 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1

this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
no real improvement 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
a bit predictable 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
good servicecheck 1

a great way to finish a great 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
not my thing 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
great sound and service 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
thank you for such great service 1

thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1
