however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0

i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great product 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1

this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the battery works great 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

a bit predictable 0 
not enough volume 0 
great phone 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
go and see it 1 
omit watching this 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
love it great armband 1 
i wont be back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i could not recommend these more 0

works like a charm works as advertised 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
worthwhile 1 
that was nice 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1

great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
a bit predictable 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
works great 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
very displeased 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
never going back 0 
never going back 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
good servicecheck 1 
omit watching this 0 
that was nice 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
excellent product for the price 1

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
great movie 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
fantastic service here 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
poor quality and service 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
a bit predictable 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this place is great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great sound and service 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great phone 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
worthwhile 1 
great phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
that was nice 1 
good case 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1

its a great item 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not my thing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
great sound and service 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
no real improvement 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0

best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
go and see it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1

nice spicy and tender 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1

thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great phone 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great product 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not a good bargain 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0

it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
either way it sucks 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
not a good bargain 0 
worst phone ever 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1
