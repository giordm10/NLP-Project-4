i gave it a 10 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
go and see it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
soggy and not good 0 
excellent short film 1 
good case 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
cool phone 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
good servicecheck 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not enough volume 0 
will not be back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
will order from them again 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
good transmit audio 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
either way it sucks 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
never going back 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this place is great 1 
great bluetooth 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
will be back again 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
great charger 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
worst phone ever 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great bluetooth 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great sound and service 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great bluetooth 1 
better than new 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
love it great armband 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
service sucks 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
love it great armband 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
love it great armband 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
will not be back 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
love it great armband 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
how awesome is that 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great bluetooth 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
good transmit audio 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
cool phone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
go watch it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
how awesome is that 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
brilliant 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0

great pizza and salads 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
excellent short film 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
better than new 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
good case 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
how awesome is that 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
that was nice 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
go watch it 1 
very displeased 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
works great 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
poor quality and service 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
that was nice 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the battery works great 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
will be back again 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1
