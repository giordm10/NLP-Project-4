those burgers were amazing 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great movie 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not enough volume 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very displeased 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
that was nice 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
how awesome is that 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
either way it sucks 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not my thing 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the battery works great 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
will order from them again 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
last time buying from you 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i wont be back 0 
will be back again 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its a great item 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i love it 1

i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
good case 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this place has it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great phone 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
excellent short film 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
brilliant 1 
not my thing 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
go watch it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great bluetooth 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
omit watching this 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
how awesome is that 1 
soggy and not good 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
omit watching this 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
works great 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
worthwhile 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
fantastic service here 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great charger 1 
this place is great 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
service sucks 0

i definitly recommend 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1

ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

worthwhile 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
works great 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
works great 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i love it 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great charger 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

awkward to use and unreliable 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1

i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
will order from them again 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
everything is appalling 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0
