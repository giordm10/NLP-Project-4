sprint terrible customer service 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
not enough volume 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
fantastic service here 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
go watch it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
will order from them again 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
go watch it 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
dont do it 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
service sucks 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
will not be back 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
love it great armband 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this place has it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great movie 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
omit watching this 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
will be back again 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i wont be back 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this place has it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the battery works great 1 
that was nice 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
poor quality and service 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a bit predictable 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great movie 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great phone 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
dont do it 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1

the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1

i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1

there are some generally great things in it 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1

service was slow and not attentive 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
go and see it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0

the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0
