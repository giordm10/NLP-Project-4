the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
excellent short film 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
great charger 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
works great 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
very displeased 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
will order from them again 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
bacon is hella salty 1

but then they came back cold 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0

technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i will not return 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent short film 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
great charger 1 
go and see it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
better than new 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
will not be back 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
its a great item 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
go and see it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
good case 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
brilliant 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
cool phone 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
will order from them again 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0

as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
works great 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great movie 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great product 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great phone 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
great phone 1 
love it great armband 1 
better than new 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1

the lighting is awful 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
omit watching this 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great phone 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
love it great armband 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1

this is a stunning movie 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1

soggy and not good 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
good case 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1

ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
not enough volume 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
how awesome is that 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0

poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1

1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1
