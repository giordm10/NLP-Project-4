however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
will be back again 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
worst phone ever 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
brilliant 1 
good case 1 
good servicecheck 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
very displeased 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
love it great armband 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
excellent product 1 
good case 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont do it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i will not return 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i want my money back 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i want my money back 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not enough volume 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not my thing 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
very displeased 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
good case 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
love it great armband 1 
worst phone ever 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great sound and service 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i wont be back 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
works great 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
service sucks 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great product 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
brilliant 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
everything is appalling 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
will not be back 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
dont do it 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
great bluetooth 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i wont be back 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great bluetooth 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
better than new 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this place is great 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i wont be back 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
cool phone 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
not my thing 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
fantastic service here 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great phone 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this place is great 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
will not be back 0 
better than new 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
not my thing 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1
