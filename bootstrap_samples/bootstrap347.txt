i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
worthwhile 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
a bit predictable 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
will order from them again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
a bit predictable 0 
that was nice 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
no real improvement 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
will order from them again 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
will be back again 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
cool phone 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
better than new 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
go and see it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
omit watching this 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
good transmit audio 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
go and see it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
great product 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
love it great armband 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
that was nice 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
better than new 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
great phone 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
omit watching this 0 
will order from them again 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i want my money back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
brilliant 1 
not my thing 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
good transmit audio 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
will be back again 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i want my money back 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
good case 1 
works great 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
crisp and clear 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
works great 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
better than new 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
very displeased 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great phone 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great movie 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great product 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
that was nice 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
excellent product 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
will be back again 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great product 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
will order from them again 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i will not return 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this place is great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1
