after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
omit watching this 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0

i couldnt take them seriously 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1

you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
soggy and not good 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

nice spicy and tender 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0

the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1

i will not return 0

everything is appalling 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0

so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0

i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
love it great armband 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i want my money back 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
that was nice 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
crisp and clear 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i want my money back 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this place has it 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
not a good bargain 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
good transmit audio 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great sound and service 1 
everything is appalling 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
great charger 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
no real improvement 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
nice spicy and tender 1

protects the phone on all sides 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
cool phone 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not my thing 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
will be back again 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
works great 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
good servicecheck 1 
great sound and service 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
warning do not buy 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this place is great 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
never going back 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
poor quality and service 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0

there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
go watch it 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellent short film 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1
