the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
very displeased 0 
great phone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i want my money back 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
never going back 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great movie 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its a great item 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i will not return 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great movie 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the battery works great 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
excellent product 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
a bit predictable 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not my thing 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
go watch it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
very displeased 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i want my money back 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
not enough volume 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
good transmit audio 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
excellent short film 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great phone 1 
go watch it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
excellent product 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
good servicecheck 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
that was nice 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
dont do it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
great bluetooth 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
love it great armband 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
good case 1 
dont do it 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
go and see it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
soggy and not good 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
not enough volume 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
worthwhile 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
good transmit audio 1 
omit watching this 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
worst phone ever 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
great charger 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not my thing 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
will not be back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great product 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
good servicecheck 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
wont ever go here again 0

its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
go watch it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1

if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great product 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
good servicecheck 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1

the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0

great for using with your home stereo 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0

buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
go and see it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this is not moviemaking 0

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
everything is appalling 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0
