will order from them again 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
service sucks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
great charger 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
better than new 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
soggy and not good 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great charger 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
not enough volume 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
everything is appalling 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the battery works great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i wont be back 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
very displeased 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
never going back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i wont be back 0 
will order from them again 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
love it great armband 1 
worthwhile 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this place has it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i love it 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
good case 1 
warning do not buy 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i wont be back 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1

not enough volume 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
not enough volume 0 
either way it sucks 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
soggy and not good 0 
good case 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
not my thing 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
good transmit audio 1 
brilliant 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not my thing 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i love it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
excellent product 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
warning do not buy 0 
worthwhile 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0

this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
soggy and not good 0

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1

thoroughly disappointed 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1
