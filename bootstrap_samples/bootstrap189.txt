also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great charger 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the battery works great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the battery works great 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0

the film looks cheap and bland 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
cool phone 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
its a great item 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
not enough volume 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this place is great 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a bit predictable 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great phone 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
worthwhile 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
that was nice 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
cool phone 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
great movie 1 
i want my money back 0 
a bit predictable 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
warning do not buy 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
will order from them again 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i want my money back 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not a good bargain 0 
excellent short film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
excellent product 1 
never going back 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great charger 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great charger 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great movie 1 
will be back again 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
excellent short film 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
better than new 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
go watch it 1 
this place has it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this place is great 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i wont be back 0 
go and see it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
good case 1 
this place is great 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
will not be back 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
service sucks 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
great phone 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this place has it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
go and see it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great product 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1
