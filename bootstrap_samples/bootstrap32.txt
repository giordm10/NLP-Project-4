the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
no real improvement 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
good case 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
not my thing 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
very displeased 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this place is great 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
good case 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i love it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
a bit predictable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
no real improvement 0 
last time buying from you 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
love it great armband 1 
service sucks 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
great charger 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the battery works great 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
worthwhile 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
that was nice 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great phone 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its a great item 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great product 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1

i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
love it great armband 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
excellent product 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
cool phone 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
a bit predictable 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
better than new 1 
how awesome is that 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
good case 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
never going back 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
service sucks 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
fantastic service here 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
brilliant 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
go and see it 1 
excellent short film 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
omit watching this 0 
great product 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great charger 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
good case 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
will order from them again 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
poor quality and service 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
how awesome is that 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
go and see it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
love it great armband 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
not enough volume 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
go watch it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
everything is appalling 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
will be back again 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
never going back 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellent short film 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
last time buying from you 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
poor quality and service 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

and it was way to expensive 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great product 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0

love the margaritas too 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
go watch it 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
love it great armband 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0

this place has it 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0

it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1
