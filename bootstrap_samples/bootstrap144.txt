julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0

the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
service sucks 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great movie 1

poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great bluetooth 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
but then they came back cold 0

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great phone 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
no real improvement 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
a bit predictable 0 
good transmit audio 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great charger 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
that was nice 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

no real improvement 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
that one didnt work either 0

buy a different phone but not this 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
that was nice 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
either way it sucks 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0

crisp and clear 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
go watch it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
good servicecheck 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1

do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
works great 1 
the kids are very cool too 1

last time buying from you 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1

the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
its a great item 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent short film 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0

great phone 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i love it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1

if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
brilliant 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1

i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0

i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place is great 1 
that one didnt work either 0

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
better than new 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1

great pizza and salads 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0
