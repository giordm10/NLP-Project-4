it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
that was nice 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its a great item 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
will not be back 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
cool phone 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
will not be back 0 
excellent product 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
no real improvement 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
excellent short film 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
service sucks 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
excellent short film 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
either way it sucks 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
not my thing 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
either way it sucks 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
soggy and not good 0 
will be back again 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
good case 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
brilliant 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
not my thing 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
go and see it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
worthwhile 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this place is great 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1

overpriced for what you are getting 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
love it great armband 1 
i will not return 0 
will not be back 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
not my thing 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0

she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1

prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
works great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
will not be back 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not my thing 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
go watch it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great phone 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
warning do not buy 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1

wont ever go here again 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not my thing 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not my thing 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this place is great 1

anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

better than new 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
no real improvement 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
go and see it 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great phone 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
love it great armband 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1
