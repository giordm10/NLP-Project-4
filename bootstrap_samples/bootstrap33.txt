but this movie really got to me 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
go watch it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
better than new 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
great charger 1 
dont do it 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i will not return 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great sound and service 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
great phone 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
good case 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i want my money back 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
not my thing 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
worst phone ever 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great product 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
that was nice 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
will be back again 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i want my money back 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
works great 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great phone 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
will not be back 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
will order from them again 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
excellent short film 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
poor quality and service 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
very displeased 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
worthwhile 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
love it great armband 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great movie 1 
great product 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
a bit predictable 0 
either way it sucks 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
bacon is hella salty 1

last time buying from you 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
works great 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this place is great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
never going back 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
soggy and not good 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love it 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
cool phone 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
go watch it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
worthwhile 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
go and see it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its a great item 1 
great movie 1
