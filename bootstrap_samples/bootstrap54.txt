i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this place has it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
love it great armband 1 
great movie 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
never going back 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
warning do not buy 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
will be back again 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
go and see it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great product 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellent product 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
works great 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
great movie 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
worst phone ever 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
will order from them again 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
excellent short film 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this place is great 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this place has it 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the battery works great 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
last time buying from you 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
great bluetooth 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
its a great item 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great product 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great sound and service 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
will be back again 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
great product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i will not return 0 
omit watching this 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
no real improvement 0 
cool phone 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
love it great armband 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
service sucks 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
never going back 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
that was nice 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
soggy and not good 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
love it great armband 1 
will order from them again 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
will order from them again 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
soggy and not good 0 
great charger 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
brilliant 1 
will be back again 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great sound and service 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
will be back again 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its a great item 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
will not be back 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
good case 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
no real improvement 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i love it 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
works great 1 
the battery works great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i wont be back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1
