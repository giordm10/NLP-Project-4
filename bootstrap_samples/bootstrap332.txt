the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
very displeased 0 
poor quality and service 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
soggy and not good 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
love it great armband 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
not my thing 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
will not be back 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
crisp and clear 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
soggy and not good 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not enough volume 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
love it great armband 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
works great 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great sound and service 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
love it great armband 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i will not return 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
go watch it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
omit watching this 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
how awesome is that 1 
works great 1 
great movie 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
that was nice 1 
great sound and service 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
fantastic service here 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
very displeased 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
everything is appalling 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
omit watching this 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
better than new 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
not a good bargain 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
last time buying from you 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
great charger 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
works great 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
never going back 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
great phone 1 
excellent short film 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i want my money back 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i want my money back 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
not enough volume 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
works great 1
