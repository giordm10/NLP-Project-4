good transmit audio 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
fantastic service here 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
not my thing 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
everything is appalling 0 
brilliant 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
worthwhile 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
very displeased 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
not a good bargain 0 
its a great item 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i love it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
worst phone ever 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
that was nice 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
good case 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
worst phone ever 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great movie 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
not my thing 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
omit watching this 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
fantastic service here 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not my thing 0 
great phone 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
excellent product 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
service sucks 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great product 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
never going back 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
excellent short film 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i will not return 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
brilliant 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this place is great 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great sound and service 1 
go watch it 1 
dont do it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
never going back 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
better than new 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
great sound and service 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this place is great 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the battery works great 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great charger 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its a great item 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
great phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great bluetooth 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
brilliant 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
will order from them again 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
poor quality and service 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this place is great 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
brilliant 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
soggy and not good 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
good servicecheck 1

will order from them again 1 
will order from them again 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
go and see it 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1
