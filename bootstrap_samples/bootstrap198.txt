however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
will be back again 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
will not be back 0 
a bit predictable 0 
this place is great 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
good case 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
excellent product 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
everything is appalling 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
will order from them again 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
last time buying from you 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
dont do it 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i want my money back 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
great product 1

and then tragedy struck 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great product 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
not my thing 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
will be back again 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
fantastic service here 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellent product 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
everything is appalling 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
go and see it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent product 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great charger 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
love it great armband 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i wont be back 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
cool phone 1 
great phone 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this place has it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i will not return 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not a good bargain 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
brilliant 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
how awesome is that 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
omit watching this 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the battery works great 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i want my money back 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not a good bargain 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
that was nice 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
omit watching this 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
brilliant 1 
dont do it 0 
works great 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
not enough volume 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1

give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
soggy and not good 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
not my thing 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great product 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0
