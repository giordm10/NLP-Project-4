they know how to make them here 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
crisp and clear 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
excellent short film 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great sound and service 1 
excellent product 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1

i love it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
go and see it 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
everything is appalling 0 
will not be back 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
not a good bargain 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
love it great armband 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
better than new 1 
the battery works great 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its a great item 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
very displeased 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
either way it sucks 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
worst phone ever 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
not enough volume 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
everything is appalling 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0

he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
excellent short film 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great bluetooth 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
will not be back 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i want my money back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great bluetooth 1 
go and see it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
better than new 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great product 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
not my thing 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
good transmit audio 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great product 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
good case 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great sound and service 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0

i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the battery works great 1 
i want my money back 0

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1

i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
either way it sucks 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
excellent short film 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
service sucks 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0

will go back next trip out 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0
