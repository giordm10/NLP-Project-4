great bluetooth 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
great product 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
great product 1 
great sound and service 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
excellent short film 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great bluetooth 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
good servicecheck 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
how awesome is that 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good servicecheck 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
no real improvement 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great product 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
great phone 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
omit watching this 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
great sound and service 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
that was nice 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not my thing 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i want my money back 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great movie 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great charger 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
that was nice 1 
i love it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
not my thing 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
will be back again 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0

excellent short film 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
worthwhile 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
poor quality and service 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the battery works great 1 
worthwhile 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great product 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1

i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1

great phone 1 
warning do not buy 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1

great pizza and salads 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
brilliant 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
excellent short film 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i definitly recommend 1
