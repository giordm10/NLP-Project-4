and the drinks are weak people 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
omit watching this 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
go watch it 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
fantastic service here 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0

excellent short film 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
go and see it 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not my thing 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
will order from them again 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
a bit predictable 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
dont do it 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
go and see it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
omit watching this 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
great movie 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i wont be back 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
excellent product 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this place is great 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
will order from them again 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great sound and service 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
go watch it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
excellent product 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
omit watching this 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
will be back again 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
no real improvement 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
a bit predictable 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its a great item 1 
this place has it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i want my money back 0 
service sucks 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
good servicecheck 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
will be back again 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i will not return 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
excellent product 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
good transmit audio 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
dont do it 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
last time buying from you 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
brilliant 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i wont be back 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
no real improvement 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
never going back 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i will not return 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
good transmit audio 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
soggy and not good 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
cool phone 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
service sucks 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not my thing 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
excellent product 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
either way it sucks 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
service sucks 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the battery works great 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great sound and service 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great movie 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
good case 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
will not be back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1

ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0
