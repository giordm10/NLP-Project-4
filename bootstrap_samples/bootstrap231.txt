the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love it 1 
great movie 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
never going back 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its a great item 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
no real improvement 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
great movie 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its a great item 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
warning do not buy 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
very displeased 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this place has it 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
not my thing 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
brilliant 1 
i will not return 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
excellent product 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
better than new 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great bluetooth 1 
soggy and not good 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
excellent short film 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
love it great armband 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great phone 1

great sound and service 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
not enough volume 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great phone 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great bluetooth 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this place is great 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
its a great item 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its a great item 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place has it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
good case 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great charger 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not my thing 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
cool phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
love it great armband 1

thank you for such great service 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
its a great item 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i will not return 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
fantastic service here 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0

warning do not buy 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0
