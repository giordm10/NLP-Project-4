lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its a great item 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1

the kids play area is nasty 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1

at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0

based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1

the directing is sloppy at best 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
crisp and clear 1

great pizza and salads 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0

its a great item 1 
very displeased 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great phone 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1

i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
last time buying from you 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
works great 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
cool phone 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its a great item 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
not a good bargain 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worthwhile 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0

as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0

it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
brilliant 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great bluetooth 1 
not a good bargain 0 
great phone 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0

overpriced for what you are getting 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this place is great 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
soggy and not good 0 
go watch it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1

ive had better atmosphere 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1

this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
love it great armband 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1

everything is appalling 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
a bit predictable 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0
