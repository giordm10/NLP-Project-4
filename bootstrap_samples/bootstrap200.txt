i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very displeased 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i will not return 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
no real improvement 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
excellent short film 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

poor quality and service 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great phone 1 
omit watching this 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
great phone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
good servicecheck 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
a bit predictable 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont do it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i was hoping for more 0

nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
great phone 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
good case 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wont be back 0 
i will not return 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
will be back again 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
warning do not buy 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
not a good bargain 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
better than new 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0

the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
works great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
not my thing 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1

this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the kids are very cool too 1

will not be back 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

the dialogue is atrocious 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0
