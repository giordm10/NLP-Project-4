if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
that was nice 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
fantastic service here 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
worst phone ever 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i want my money back 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great sound and service 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
excellent product 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
worthwhile 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
good case 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
how awesome is that 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not my thing 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
no real improvement 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i want my money back 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
soggy and not good 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
dont do it 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great phone 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
works great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
its a great item 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
either way it sucks 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place is great 1 
everything is appalling 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the battery works great 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
cool phone 1 
service sucks 0 
great charger 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
service sucks 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
dont do it 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i love it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
go and see it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i will not return 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the battery works great 1 
better than new 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great movie 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wont be back 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
good servicecheck 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its a great item 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
will order from them again 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
that was nice 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
crisp and clear 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
omit watching this 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
worthwhile 1 
good case 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
that was nice 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this place has it 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
brilliant 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
will order from them again 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
soggy and not good 0
