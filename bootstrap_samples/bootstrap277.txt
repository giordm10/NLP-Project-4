the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i will not return 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
very displeased 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
soggy and not good 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the battery works great 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
will not be back 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
omit watching this 0 
i love it 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
excellent product 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great phone 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
poor quality and service 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
very displeased 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great charger 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
works great 1 
not my thing 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont do it 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
worthwhile 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
worst phone ever 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
fantastic service here 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
great movie 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
a bit predictable 0 
this place has it 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great bluetooth 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
good case 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1

i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its a great item 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
good transmit audio 1

service sucks 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1

very little music or anything to speak of 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
that was nice 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
we loved the biscuits 1

brilliant 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
that was nice 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
works great 1

i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
everything is appalling 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
excellent product for the price 1

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
service sucks 0 
better than new 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
will order from them again 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

great for using with your home stereo 1 
this place is great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0

it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0

always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
brilliant 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0
