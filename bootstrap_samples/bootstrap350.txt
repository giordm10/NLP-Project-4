my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i will not return 0

talk about useless customer service 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
excellent product 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
fantastic service here 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
good case 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
go and see it 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
not my thing 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
will not be back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
warning do not buy 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the battery works great 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the battery works great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
no real improvement 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this place is great 1 
everything is appalling 0 
no real improvement 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
that was nice 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worst phone ever 0 
go and see it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
crisp and clear 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
warning do not buy 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
very displeased 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
excellent short film 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
go and see it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great movie 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
cool phone 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

but this movie really got to me 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1

we loved the biscuits 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
love it great armband 1

provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1

its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
service sucks 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0

this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
works great 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i will not return 0
