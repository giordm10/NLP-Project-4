wont ever go here again 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not a good bargain 0 
great phone 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
good transmit audio 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0
