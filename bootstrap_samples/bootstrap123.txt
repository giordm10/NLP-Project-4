i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
service sucks 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

good case 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
very displeased 0

the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1

at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
talk about useless customer service 0

one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0

its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0

its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0

excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
that was nice 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0

a great way to finish a great 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
better than new 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this place is great 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0

after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0

good transmit audio 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
better than new 1

its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i wont be back 0

good servicecheck 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
we loved the biscuits 1

i will not return 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1
