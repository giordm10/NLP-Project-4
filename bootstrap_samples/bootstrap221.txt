in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
better than new 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
never going back 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great sound and service 1 
omit watching this 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
worst phone ever 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
will be back again 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
its a great item 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great bluetooth 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
go and see it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
last time buying from you 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
very displeased 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
excellent short film 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
go watch it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
works great 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
great movie 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
worst phone ever 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
never going back 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1

the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0

we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
very displeased 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
that was nice 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
dont do it 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
not a good bargain 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1

very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this place is great 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
excellent short film 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1

poor quality and service 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
go and see it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1

if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0

based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0

every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1

i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
good case 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0
