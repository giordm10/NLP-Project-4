they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i love it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great movie 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
very displeased 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
worthwhile 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
worthwhile 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
its a great item 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
will order from them again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
good servicecheck 1 
go and see it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
its a great item 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
that was nice 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its a great item 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
no real improvement 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
will order from them again 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
soggy and not good 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i wont be back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great charger 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
warning do not buy 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i love it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
worthwhile 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great charger 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i will not return 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
that was nice 1 
will be back again 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
service sucks 0 
crisp and clear 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great charger 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
great phone 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
not my thing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great bluetooth 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
very displeased 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the battery works great 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i love it 1 
worthwhile 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
either way it sucks 0 
brilliant 1 
i want my money back 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
great product 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
good case 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
not enough volume 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1
