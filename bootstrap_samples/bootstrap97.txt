i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
poor quality and service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
will order from them again 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
go watch it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
great movie 1 
i will not return 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
excellent product 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
very displeased 0 
not enough volume 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent product 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great product 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great charger 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
everything is appalling 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
everything is appalling 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not a good bargain 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
that was nice 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
omit watching this 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great phone 1 
great movie 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the battery works great 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great phone 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
will order from them again 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
love it great armband 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great sound and service 1 
sauce was tasteless 0

the battery works great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
good transmit audio 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1

soggy and not good 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0

it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1

lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
go watch it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
not my thing 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0

very displeased 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
service sucks 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
no real improvement 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
better than new 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1

its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0

looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1

obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0

vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1
