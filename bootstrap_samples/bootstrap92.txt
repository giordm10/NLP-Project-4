i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
dont do it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
great product 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i want my money back 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1

the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
great sound and service 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
how awesome is that 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great movie 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
never going back 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
excellent product 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
very displeased 0 
a bit predictable 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
service sucks 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great charger 1 
poor quality and service 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great phone 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i want my money back 0 
poor quality and service 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i want my money back 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its a great item 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
cool phone 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
good case 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great sound and service 1 
excellent short film 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
works great 1 
brilliant 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
soggy and not good 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
very displeased 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i love it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
service sucks 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worthwhile 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
service sucks 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0

it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
that was nice 1 
soggy and not good 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
definitely a bargain 1

service sucks 0

good case 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0

ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
good servicecheck 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1
