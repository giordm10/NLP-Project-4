it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
warning do not buy 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great phone 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent short film 1 
dont do it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
dont do it 0 
this place is great 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
that was nice 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
never going back 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i wont be back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
omit watching this 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
service sucks 0 
cool phone 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
its a great item 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont do it 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
will be back again 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
will order from them again 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
will order from them again 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
a bit predictable 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i will not return 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
dont do it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
soggy and not good 0 
will be back again 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
dont do it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i will not return 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
worthwhile 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
fantastic service here 1 
a bit predictable 0 
warning do not buy 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this place is great 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
no real improvement 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
good case 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
very displeased 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
dont do it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the battery works great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i wont be back 0 
i will not return 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
service sucks 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0

anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i will not return 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
everything is appalling 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
great movie 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1
