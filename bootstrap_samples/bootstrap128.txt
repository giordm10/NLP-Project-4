the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
how awesome is that 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
will not be back 0 
great charger 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the battery works great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great phone 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
good case 1 
will order from them again 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
brilliant 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
excellent product 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i want my money back 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
its a great item 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i will not return 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
fantastic service here 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
service sucks 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
not a good bargain 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1

excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
poor quality and service 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the battery works great 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the battery works great 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
great sound and service 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
will not be back 0 
i love it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
very displeased 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
works great 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
will not be back 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
poor quality and service 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the battery works great 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the battery works great 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
no real improvement 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
poor quality and service 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
fantastic service here 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1

its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1

will not be back 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1

that was nice 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
dont do it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
will order from them again 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its a great item 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i will not return 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
works great 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
good servicecheck 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
poor quality and service 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1

a great way to finish a great 1 
i want my money back 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
not enough volume 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
dont do it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
not enough volume 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i will not return 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
good servicecheck 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1
