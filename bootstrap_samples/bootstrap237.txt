every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great phone 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
go watch it 1 
its a great item 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
worthwhile 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
great movie 1 
service sucks 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
either way it sucks 0 
good servicecheck 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the battery works great 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i will not return 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
cool phone 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
excellent product 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
that was nice 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
worthwhile 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
that was nice 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
excellent product 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
everything is appalling 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
works great 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
go watch it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
very displeased 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
go watch it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great phone 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great bluetooth 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i will not return 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great charger 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
will not be back 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
works great 1 
not enough volume 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
never going back 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great phone 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0

the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great charger 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great charger 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
not my thing 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i love it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i will not return 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
great bluetooth 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
dont do it 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
never going back 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
dont do it 0 
dont do it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
warning do not buy 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i will not return 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
great movie 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
poor quality and service 0 
excellent short film 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
great sound and service 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1

great phone 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
never going back 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
will order from them again 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the battery works great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i want my money back 0 
great product 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1
