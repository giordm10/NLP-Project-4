i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0

and the drinks are weak people 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1

what a big waste of time 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1
