battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
a bit predictable 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
a bit predictable 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
last time buying from you 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
go and see it 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
either way it sucks 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
either way it sucks 0

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
never going back 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
last time buying from you 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
better than new 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1

shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i want my money back 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
service sucks 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
brilliant 1

final word this show is a real torture 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1

i could not recommend these more 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
service sucks 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
not my thing 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great movie 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1

really really good rice all the time 1

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

i was hoping for more 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1

great phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
everything is appalling 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
either way it sucks 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
excellent short film 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
cool phone 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
brilliant 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
great charger 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
no real improvement 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
that was nice 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
go watch it 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
no real improvement 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0

the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
will be back again 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0
