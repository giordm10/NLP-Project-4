the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
not a good bargain 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
excellent product 1

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this place has it 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great movie 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
how awesome is that 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
omit watching this 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
service sucks 0 
not my thing 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
not a good bargain 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
not enough volume 0 
dont do it 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i wont be back 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i want my money back 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
worthwhile 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
go and see it 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
cool phone 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
worst phone ever 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great product 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
no real improvement 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
dont do it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0

i couldnt take them seriously 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
poor quality and service 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0

talk about useless customer service 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1

this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
works great 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

nice spicy and tender 1 
good servicecheck 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1

overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
love it great armband 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1

prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great phone 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
love it great armband 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0

his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
its a great item 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1

however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0

anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great phone 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0

not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1
