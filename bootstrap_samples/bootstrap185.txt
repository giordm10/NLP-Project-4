technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great product 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
will be back again 1 
soggy and not good 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
no real improvement 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great phone 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
go watch it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
last time buying from you 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i love it 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this place has it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
service sucks 0 
great phone 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
excellent product 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
very displeased 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great movie 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
great product 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great charger 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
go watch it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
poor quality and service 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
soggy and not good 0

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great sound and service 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
warning do not buy 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
never going back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
good case 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
will order from them again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
worthwhile 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
warning do not buy 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
better than new 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
brilliant 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
will not be back 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
will order from them again 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i want my money back 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
a bit predictable 0 
never going back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
everything is appalling 0

this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
works great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1

brilliant 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great charger 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0
