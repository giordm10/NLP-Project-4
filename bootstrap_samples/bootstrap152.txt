poor quality and service 0 
great charger 1

display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
never going back 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0

the kids are very cool too 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0

best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
great phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0

this is not moviemaking 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
love it great armband 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1

how awesome is that 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0

it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
will order from them again 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this place has it 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
go and see it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
crisp and clear 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0

the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great movie 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the battery works great 1 
this place has it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1

no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
will order from them again 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1

dont waste your money and time 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0

i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
good case 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great bluetooth 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0

i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great sound and service 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great charger 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1

you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
no real improvement 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i will not return 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i want my money back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0

i was hoping for more 0 
worthwhile 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1
