plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i want my money back 0 
worthwhile 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the battery works great 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
will not be back 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
that was nice 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
will be back again 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
last time buying from you 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
love it great armband 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
great phone 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great charger 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
that was nice 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
great phone 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great charger 1 
i want my money back 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
warning do not buy 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
not enough volume 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great phone 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
never going back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
no real improvement 0 
soggy and not good 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
that was nice 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
go and see it 1 
very displeased 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
dont do it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
never going back 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
love it great armband 1 
great sound and service 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
poor quality and service 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i will not return 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
crisp and clear 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
very displeased 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
will be back again 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i wont be back 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
how awesome is that 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1

i definitly recommend 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellent short film 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
better than new 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
everything is appalling 0 
will not be back 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this place has it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
excellent short film 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont do it 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1

very displeased 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its a great item 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
that was nice 1

not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great sound and service 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this place is great 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
will not be back 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0

never had anything to complain about here 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
excellent short film 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1

his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
go and see it 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0

great sound and service 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
good case 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0
