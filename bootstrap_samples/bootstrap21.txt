one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
soggy and not good 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great product 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
soggy and not good 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
omit watching this 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i will not return 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
love it great armband 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i love it 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
last time buying from you 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
love it great armband 1 
excellent short film 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
warning do not buy 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the battery works great 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
either way it sucks 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i will not return 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
will be back again 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i love it 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this place is great 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
that was nice 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
will not be back 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
no real improvement 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i will not return 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
works great 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
good case 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0

if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not enough volume 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i love it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
fantastic service here 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
dont do it 0 
that was nice 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
either way it sucks 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
poor quality and service 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
works great 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0

poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1

its a great item 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1
