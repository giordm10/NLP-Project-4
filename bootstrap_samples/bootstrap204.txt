this place has it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
not my thing 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
go and see it 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this place has it 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
either way it sucks 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
good transmit audio 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
will be back again 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
great sound and service 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
good case 1 
omit watching this 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
excellent product 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
good case 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
no real improvement 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great phone 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great phone 1 
service sucks 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
no real improvement 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
not enough volume 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
will be back again 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
will be back again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its a great item 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
excellent product 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i will not return 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
excellent product 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very displeased 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its a great item 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
excellent short film 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
a bit predictable 0 
omit watching this 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its a great item 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
good case 1 
will not be back 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
brilliant 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great phone 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
brilliant 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
go watch it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
great bluetooth 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
that was nice 1 
not enough volume 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
worthwhile 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
omit watching this 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
will be back again 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
go watch it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
go and see it 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
love it great armband 1 
crisp and clear 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great product 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great phone 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0
