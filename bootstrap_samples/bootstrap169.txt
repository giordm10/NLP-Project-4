the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great phone 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great charger 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
omit watching this 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
love it great armband 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
no real improvement 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
everything is appalling 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great sound and service 1 
never going back 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
will order from them again 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great sound and service 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great sound and service 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great product 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i want my money back 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0

best bluetooth on the market 1

obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1

great charger 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
service sucks 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
no real improvement 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
good transmit audio 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
excellent product 1 
not a good bargain 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
cool phone 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
very displeased 0

that one didnt work either 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0

angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
worthwhile 1
