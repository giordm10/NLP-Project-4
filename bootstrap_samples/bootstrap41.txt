will go back next trip out 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
worst phone ever 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
will be back again 1 
this place is great 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
very displeased 0 
the battery works great 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great phone 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
that was nice 1 
this place has it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great movie 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worthwhile 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
will order from them again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
go watch it 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
not my thing 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
no real improvement 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
how awesome is that 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
omit watching this 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
dont do it 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
go watch it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great movie 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great movie 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the battery works great 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i will not return 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
will order from them again 1 
i love it 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
never going back 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
excellent product 1 
poor quality and service 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
brilliant 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this place has it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
worthwhile 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
everything is appalling 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
better than new 1 
works great 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this place is great 1 
omit watching this 0 
never going back 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
either way it sucks 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
works great 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent product 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great sound and service 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
excellent product 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
omit watching this 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
love it great armband 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
will not be back 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i want my money back 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
never going back 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its a great item 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
fantastic service here 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this place has it 1 
the battery works great 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
not my thing 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
love it great armband 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
poor quality and service 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
brilliant 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i love it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
never going back 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0
