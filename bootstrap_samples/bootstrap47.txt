this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
not enough volume 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
better than new 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
good case 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
a bit predictable 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i will not return 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i wont be back 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not my thing 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i wont be back 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
brilliant 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
very displeased 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i love it 1 
great phone 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
cool phone 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
warning do not buy 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i will not return 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the battery works great 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
never going back 0 
go and see it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great movie 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this place is great 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
good case 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great movie 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this place is great 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
dont do it 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
cool phone 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1

this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1

this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0

great phone 1 
i gave it a 10 1

but then they came back cold 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
fantastic service here 1

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great product 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0
