excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
excellent short film 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
clear crisp sound 1

great movie 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i wont be back 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
that was nice 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
excellent product 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
dont do it 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
no real improvement 0 
will be back again 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
better than new 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
great movie 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
no real improvement 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
worthwhile 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0

i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
great phone 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great phone 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
never going back 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this place has it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i want my money back 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this place is great 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
excellent short film 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
good case 1 
will be back again 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
either way it sucks 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great sound and service 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
how awesome is that 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great phone 1 
go watch it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i love it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
brilliant 1 
excellent short film 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
that was nice 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
dont do it 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i wont be back 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
good case 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
good servicecheck 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0
