please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
go and see it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellent short film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great product 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the battery works great 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great product 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
not enough volume 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
good transmit audio 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
never going back 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
good servicecheck 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
everything is appalling 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i love it 1 
love it great armband 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
never going back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
not my thing 0 
the battery works great 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its a great item 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
worthwhile 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
will be back again 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
worthwhile 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i wont be back 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
love it great armband 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wont be back 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
dont do it 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great phone 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i will not return 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
service sucks 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
very displeased 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
omit watching this 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
cool phone 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
will not be back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
works great 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
that was nice 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
omit watching this 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
poor quality and service 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
not a good bargain 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great product 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i love it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i want my money back 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
good transmit audio 1 
great bluetooth 1 
love it great armband 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
definitely a bargain 1
