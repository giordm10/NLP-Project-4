needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
good servicecheck 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great phone 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
poor quality and service 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
excellent product 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i want my money back 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
that was nice 1 
very displeased 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great phone 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not enough volume 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
worst phone ever 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
brilliant 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great sound and service 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
excellent product 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
soggy and not good 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i want my money back 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0

display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
go watch it 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
either way it sucks 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
good transmit audio 1 
very displeased 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
better than new 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i love it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
no real improvement 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
will be back again 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
go and see it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
worst phone ever 0

the battery works great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0

1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great movie 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0

that one didnt work either 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is a stunning movie 1

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0

the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
its a great item 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0

all three broke within two months of use 0

it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
will order from them again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
will order from them again 1 
the battery works great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1

not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
works great 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
dont do it 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0
