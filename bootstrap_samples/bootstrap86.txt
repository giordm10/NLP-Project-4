we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
will not be back 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
good servicecheck 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
service sucks 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i want my money back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not my thing 0 
last time buying from you 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i wont be back 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great movie 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great phone 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
go and see it 1 
great movie 1 
great product 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
how awesome is that 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
go and see it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a great item 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
excellent product 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
good transmit audio 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i will not return 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i want my money back 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
go watch it 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
its a great item 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1

authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
brilliant 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
poor quality and service 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
its a great item 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
go and see it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
how awesome is that 1 
its a great item 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
brilliant 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great movie 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
cool phone 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great charger 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
excellent short film 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not enough volume 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
good case 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
good case 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0

the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0

the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this place is great 1 
service sucks 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
excellent product 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great phone 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0

i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wont be back 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
will order from them again 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
excellent product 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the battery works great 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
fantastic service here 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
great bluetooth 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great phone 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great charger 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great movie 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great bluetooth 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this place is great 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
never going back 0 
excellent product 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1
