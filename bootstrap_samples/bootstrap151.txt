this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
warning do not buy 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
a bit predictable 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
will not be back 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
worst phone ever 0 
never going back 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
poor quality and service 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
worthwhile 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wont be back 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not enough volume 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
cool phone 1 
omit watching this 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
go and see it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great bluetooth 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
excellent short film 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great sound and service 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
not my thing 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
excellent product 1 
very displeased 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
worthwhile 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
works great 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i wont be back 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
omit watching this 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
works great 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great phone 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great charger 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
great phone 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i love it 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
not a good bargain 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
good transmit audio 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i love it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
good servicecheck 1 
great product 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i wont be back 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i want my money back 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0

shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but then they came back cold 0

the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0

my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great movie 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0

today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
go and see it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0

if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
never going back 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1
