the lighting is awful 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1

the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0

google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1

looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0

the atmosphere here is fun 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1

an excellent performance from ms 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
will not be back 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
great bluetooth 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i wont be back 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
service sucks 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great phone 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
excellent short film 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great sound and service 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
cool phone 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
excellent short film 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
love it great armband 1 
will be back again 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
brilliant 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
very displeased 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
a bit predictable 0 
very displeased 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
love it great armband 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this place is great 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0

last time buying from you 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the battery works great 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1

i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
warning do not buy 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
dont do it 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
worst phone ever 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0

i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1

fantastic service here 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
either way it sucks 0

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0

great bluetooth 1 
this place has it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
a bit predictable 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
very displeased 0 
excellent product 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
good case 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1
