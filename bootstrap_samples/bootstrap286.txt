the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
either way it sucks 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
no real improvement 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good servicecheck 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great product 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this place has it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
better than new 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
works great 1 
will order from them again 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
love it great armband 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
worthwhile 1 
the battery works great 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
that was nice 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
love it great armband 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
fantastic service here 1 
not enough volume 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the battery works great 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1

it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
better than new 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
everything is appalling 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i want my money back 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
go and see it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
love it great armband 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this place is great 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i could not recommend these more 0

the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
not enough volume 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
warning do not buy 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i wont be back 0 
fantastic service here 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
battery is holding up well 1

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
sauce was tasteless 0

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0

it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1

it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this is not moviemaking 0

this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
go and see it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
excellent product 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0

there are some generally great things in it 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the battery works great 1 
better than new 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great product 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
excellent short film 1
