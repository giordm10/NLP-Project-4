i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
worst phone ever 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
excellent short film 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i love it 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
fantastic service here 1 
will be back again 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i will not return 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
warning do not buy 0 
excellent short film 1 
the battery works great 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great phone 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1

virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worthwhile 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
omit watching this 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

but then they came back cold 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
better than new 1

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0

in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the battery works great 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0

excellent product 1 
service sucks 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

i couldnt take them seriously 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
dont do it 0 
not a good bargain 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i wont be back 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

i love it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
excellent short film 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
love it great armband 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
that was nice 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
very displeased 0

a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
warning do not buy 0 
love it great armband 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
soggy and not good 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
will order from them again 1 
better than new 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0

the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0

jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0

every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1
