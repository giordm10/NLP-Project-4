when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
worthwhile 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
worst phone ever 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
better than new 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
no real improvement 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
great phone 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i want my money back 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not enough volume 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
not my thing 0 
never going back 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
service sucks 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great bluetooth 1 
brilliant 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
good case 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
great product 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
either way it sucks 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
works great 1 
go and see it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
great phone 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
great movie 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
good servicecheck 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great movie 1 
how awesome is that 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great charger 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
works great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
crisp and clear 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
excellent product 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great product 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great sound and service 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
go and see it 1 
service sucks 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
brilliant 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
better than new 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
brilliant 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
love it great armband 1 
go and see it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i love it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
warning do not buy 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
good servicecheck 1 
better than new 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great charger 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
not my thing 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i will not return 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
go watch it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
will be back again 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
fantastic service here 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
not my thing 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i wont be back 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great sound and service 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the battery works great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
that was nice 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
never going back 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1
