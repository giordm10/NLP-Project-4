it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
service sucks 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great phone 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
go watch it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great bluetooth 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
fantastic service here 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not my thing 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great product 1 
worthwhile 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great phone 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
last time buying from you 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great sound and service 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i wont be back 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i will not return 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
dont do it 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great phone 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the battery works great 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
will be back again 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
excellent product 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
not enough volume 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
will not be back 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not my thing 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great sound and service 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the battery works great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
very displeased 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this place is great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
go watch it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this place has it 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
not enough volume 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
love it great armband 1 
never going back 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great movie 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
works great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not my thing 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
fantastic service here 1 
go watch it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
great sound and service 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
crisp and clear 1 
go watch it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
great phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
will be back again 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this place has it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this place has it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great product 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
no real improvement 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1

my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

the kids are very cool too 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
cool phone 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0

jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0
