the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0

i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1

good servicecheck 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this place has it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
go watch it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0

i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
great phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i wont be back 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great phone 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0

the kids play area is nasty 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1

ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
good servicecheck 1

great sound and service 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
go watch it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
definitely a bargain 1

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1

this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0

battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0

the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
will not be back 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0

poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0

this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
excellent product 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0

it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1
