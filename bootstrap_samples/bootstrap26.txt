she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
will not be back 0 
great sound and service 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great phone 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
no real improvement 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
better than new 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this place is great 1 
great movie 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
good transmit audio 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
dont do it 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
excellent product 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
crisp and clear 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great sound and service 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
worst phone ever 0 
worthwhile 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
last time buying from you 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
go and see it 1 
this place has it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
everything is appalling 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
will not be back 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
a bit predictable 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i will not return 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
go and see it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1

if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
cool phone 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
no real improvement 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i want my money back 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
good case 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
excellent product 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
not a good bargain 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great phone 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great charger 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0
