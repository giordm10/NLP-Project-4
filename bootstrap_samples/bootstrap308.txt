but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
great product 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great sound and service 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
omit watching this 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
omit watching this 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
everything is appalling 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great phone 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
great charger 1 
warning do not buy 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
no real improvement 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
no real improvement 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i will not return 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
poor quality and service 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
will be back again 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
excellent product 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i will not return 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
great phone 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
soggy and not good 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
worthwhile 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
everything is appalling 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
fantastic service here 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
worthwhile 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
good case 1 
great bluetooth 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
better than new 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
never going back 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
excellent product 1 
very displeased 0 
great product 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
very displeased 0 
that was nice 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
its a great item 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great charger 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i will not return 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
not a good bargain 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
very displeased 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
cool phone 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
go and see it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
better than new 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
good servicecheck 1 
dont do it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
love it great armband 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great phone 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i love it 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
service sucks 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
will be back again 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
that was nice 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
worthwhile 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
a bit predictable 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
good case 1 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
worthwhile 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
better than new 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
never going back 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1
