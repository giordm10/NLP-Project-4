it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
good transmit audio 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
not enough volume 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
either way it sucks 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
go and see it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
a bit predictable 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i love it 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
go watch it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
last time buying from you 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
never going back 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
good case 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
excellent product 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
great movie 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great sound and service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
great product 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
good servicecheck 1

also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great movie 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
good servicecheck 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellent product 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
last time buying from you 0 
its a great item 1 
worst phone ever 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1

if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
very displeased 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1

also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0

the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
better than new 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
great sound and service 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0

nice spicy and tender 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0

the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
will be back again 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
service sucks 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
not a good bargain 0
