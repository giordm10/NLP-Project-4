and it was way to expensive 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
omit watching this 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
not my thing 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
excellent short film 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
will order from them again 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
everything is appalling 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
how awesome is that 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
go and see it 1 
this place is great 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
not a good bargain 0 
how awesome is that 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
works great 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
works great 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
poor quality and service 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not my thing 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
will order from them again 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
excellent short film 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
go watch it 1 
i will not return 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
poor quality and service 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great product 1 
brilliant 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
very displeased 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
great phone 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great product 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
excellent product 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
not enough volume 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
good case 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
dont do it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great product 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
works great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great phone 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
go and see it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
worthwhile 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great sound and service 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
will be back again 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great sound and service 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i want my money back 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this place has it 1 
will order from them again 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this place has it 1 
better than new 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
excellent short film 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this place has it 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
service sucks 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
how awesome is that 1 
great sound and service 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0
