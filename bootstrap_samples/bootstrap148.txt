i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0

i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1

the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
omit watching this 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great movie 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
fantastic service here 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the battery works great 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
warning do not buy 0 
go watch it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i want my money back 0 
will order from them again 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great phone 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
not my thing 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
works great 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
will order from them again 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
omit watching this 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
better than new 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
poor quality and service 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1

this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
not my thing 0 
last time buying from you 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
either way it sucks 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
go and see it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
service sucks 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
better than new 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great product 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
no real improvement 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
will not be back 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great phone 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great movie 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
crisp and clear 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
will order from them again 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
worthwhile 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
good case 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0

one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
fantastic service here 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i wont be back 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1

angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
omit watching this 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great bluetooth 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0

great bluetooth 1

great product 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1

a bit predictable 0

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not a good bargain 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this place is great 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0

dont do it 0 
will order from them again 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0

i love it 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1

i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
fantastic service here 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
not my thing 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0
