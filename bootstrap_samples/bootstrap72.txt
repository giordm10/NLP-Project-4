sprint terrible customer service 0 
better than new 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
a bit predictable 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
dont do it 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
excellent short film 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0

tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
not my thing 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
good servicecheck 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
never going back 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
will be back again 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great phone 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
never going back 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
omit watching this 0 
the battery works great 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
cool phone 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
will not be back 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
that was nice 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
everything is appalling 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great charger 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
not enough volume 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
never going back 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
will not be back 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
service sucks 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
service sucks 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0

great pizza and salads 1 
cool phone 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
omit watching this 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
its a great item 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
brilliant 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
no real improvement 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0

this is not moviemaking 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this place is great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
not enough volume 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1

ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i wont be back 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
no real improvement 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0
