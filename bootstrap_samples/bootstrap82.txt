worst phone ever 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
will be back again 1 
great charger 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great product 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
will be back again 1 
i wont be back 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
omit watching this 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
not my thing 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
not my thing 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
worst phone ever 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
cool phone 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the battery works great 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i wont be back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great charger 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
go watch it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
love it great armband 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont do it 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
go watch it 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i want my money back 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this place is great 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
brilliant 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
love it great armband 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
service sucks 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
its a great item 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
better than new 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its a great item 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
last time buying from you 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
good transmit audio 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
love it great armband 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this place has it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
good transmit audio 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
worthwhile 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
that was nice 1

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0

this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0

excellent product for the price 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1

great product 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1

authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0
