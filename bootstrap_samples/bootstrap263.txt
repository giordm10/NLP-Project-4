the rest of the cast also play well 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not my thing 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i will not return 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
great sound and service 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
poor quality and service 0 
soggy and not good 0 
will order from them again 1 
warning do not buy 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this place has it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
not enough volume 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this place has it 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
not my thing 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
cool phone 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
excellent product 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great sound and service 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
great movie 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
never going back 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
go and see it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
go watch it 1 
go and see it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not my thing 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great phone 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0

not enough volume 0 
its a great item 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
never going back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
worthwhile 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
worthwhile 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
very displeased 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
worthwhile 1

tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
everything is appalling 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
that was nice 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the battery works great 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
brilliant 1

i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
better than new 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1

i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i wont be back 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i want my money back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
worst phone ever 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great movie 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
great phone 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the lighting is awful 0

i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0
