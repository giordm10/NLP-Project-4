i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
service sucks 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
service sucks 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
warning do not buy 0 
great phone 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great phone 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
will not be back 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the battery works great 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
will order from them again 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
good transmit audio 1 
works great 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
works great 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
great sound and service 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great movie 1 
its a great item 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
better than new 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
will be back again 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
not enough volume 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
great movie 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
go and see it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
not my thing 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
good case 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
cool phone 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
omit watching this 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
great charger 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
either way it sucks 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
good case 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
go and see it 1 
love it great armband 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
its a great item 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
service sucks 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great sound and service 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
crisp and clear 1 
good servicecheck 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
love it great armband 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
that was nice 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great sound and service 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great phone 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0

it didnt charge for me 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
its a great item 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
its a great item 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1
