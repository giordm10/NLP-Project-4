i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1

i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
go watch it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
service sucks 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1

sprint terrible customer service 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
cool phone 1 
go and see it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0

every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great charger 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
better than new 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

all three broke within two months of use 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0

jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1

if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1

however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this place has it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1

by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
go watch it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not a good bargain 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
dont do it 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
go watch it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
not enough volume 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i love it 1

this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
battery is holding up well 1

bacon is hella salty 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
either way it sucks 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

brilliant 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
love it great armband 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
warning do not buy 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent product 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1

this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0

this place has it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great phone 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
cool phone 1
