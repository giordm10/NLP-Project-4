authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
soggy and not good 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
everything is appalling 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
not enough volume 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
dont do it 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this place is great 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
not my thing 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i will not return 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this place has it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
not my thing 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
good case 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i wont be back 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
will order from them again 1 
i want my money back 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
good case 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i love it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
will not be back 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
its a great item 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
great sound and service 1 
not a good bargain 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
good transmit audio 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i love it 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i love it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
service sucks 0 
i love it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great movie 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
better than new 1 
great phone 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
go and see it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
service sucks 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1

a great way to finish a great 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0

i want my money back 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
its a great item 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
never going back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0

service sucks 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
never going back 0

excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1

in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1

the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i gave it a 10 1

ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

poor quality and service 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
fantastic service here 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1

not enough volume 0 
excellent short film 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0

this is a stunning movie 1 
last time buying from you 0 
it didnt charge for me 0

our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1

overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0
