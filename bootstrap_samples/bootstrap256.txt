not enough volume 0 
works great 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
its a great item 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great phone 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
good case 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
go watch it 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
go and see it 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
good case 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
not my thing 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
its a great item 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
everything is appalling 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the battery works great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
go and see it 1 
i want my money back 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
good transmit audio 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great phone 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont do it 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
a bit predictable 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
will not be back 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
great sound and service 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not enough volume 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i will not return 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
love it great armband 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
great phone 1 
good transmit audio 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great product 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
great phone 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
worst phone ever 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
either way it sucks 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
will order from them again 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great bluetooth 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
will be back again 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
go watch it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
go watch it 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
service sucks 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
a bit predictable 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
a bit predictable 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
worthwhile 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
great phone 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
fantastic service here 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
everything is appalling 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great product 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
better than new 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
better than new 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
will order from them again 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i love it 1 
that was nice 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
dont do it 0 
great movie 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
works great 1
