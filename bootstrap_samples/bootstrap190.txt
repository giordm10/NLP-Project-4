brilliant 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
a bit predictable 0 
its a great item 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
not enough volume 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
great product 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
will not be back 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
no real improvement 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
will order from them again 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
that was nice 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
will be back again 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1

if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
good transmit audio 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
how awesome is that 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
great product 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
cool phone 1 
worthwhile 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
will be back again 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the battery works great 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont do it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i will not return 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
good servicecheck 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
worst phone ever 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
crisp and clear 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i wont be back 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
not my thing 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0

i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
its a great item 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
good transmit audio 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
how awesome is that 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1

great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0

the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
bacon is hella salty 1

jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1
