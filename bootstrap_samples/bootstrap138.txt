very little music or anything to speak of 0

the commercials are the most misleading 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
warning do not buy 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
excellent short film 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
go and see it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
omit watching this 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
last time buying from you 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
good transmit audio 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i love it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the battery works great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
love it great armband 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
excellent short film 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
how awesome is that 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
clear crisp sound 1

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i love it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0

what a big waste of time 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1

but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
dont do it 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
a great way to finish a great 1

tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0
