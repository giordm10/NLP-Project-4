ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i will not return 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
battery is holding up well 1

looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i wont be back 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great charger 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
great phone 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
poor quality and service 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great product 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i love it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
soggy and not good 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i love it 1 
that was nice 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
not a good bargain 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great sound and service 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
great phone 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
better than new 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
worthwhile 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great charger 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i love it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
will order from them again 1 
better than new 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great product 1 
go and see it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
better than new 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
will not be back 0 
last time buying from you 0 
not a good bargain 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
no real improvement 0 
the battery works great 1 
not enough volume 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
great phone 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this place is great 1 
go and see it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
not a good bargain 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
will order from them again 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great bluetooth 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this place is great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
service sucks 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the battery works great 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
either way it sucks 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
brilliant 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
omit watching this 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
that was nice 1 
i love it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
cool phone 1 
a bit predictable 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i love it 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i want my money back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
no real improvement 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great charger 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
service sucks 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
worst phone ever 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not a good bargain 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
go watch it 1
