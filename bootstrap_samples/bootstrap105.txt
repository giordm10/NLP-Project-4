virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great bluetooth 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
great phone 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
great phone 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
brilliant 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i wont be back 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this place has it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great product 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great movie 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
very displeased 0 
everything is appalling 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
not a good bargain 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
great phone 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
not a good bargain 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
excellent short film 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
great bluetooth 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
will not be back 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i wont be back 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this place is great 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
very displeased 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
no real improvement 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this place is great 1 
poor quality and service 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent product 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

thoroughly disappointed 0 
great sound and service 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i love it 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
will not be back 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
go watch it 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
poor quality and service 0 
that was nice 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
avoid at all cost 0

anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the battery works great 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great charger 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i will not return 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
service sucks 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
worthwhile 1 
its a great item 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0

i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

sauce was tasteless 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0
