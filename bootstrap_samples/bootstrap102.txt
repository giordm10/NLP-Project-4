my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
everything is appalling 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i will not return 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
warning do not buy 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
its a great item 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
nice spicy and tender 1

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
good servicecheck 1

the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0

excellent short film 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0

the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0

no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0

it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
we loved the biscuits 1

dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
not enough volume 0

every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the battery works great 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0

go and see it 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
go watch it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the battery works great 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i wont be back 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
excellent short film 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
a bit predictable 0 
fantastic service here 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
better than new 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0

we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
good transmit audio 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
excellent short film 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1

service sucks 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
no real improvement 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1

fantastic service here 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
brilliant 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i love it 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the battery works great 1 
the battery works great 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
never going back 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not enough volume 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
very displeased 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
everything is appalling 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0

i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0

i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great movie 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this place has it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0

its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
no real improvement 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1

one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
will not be back 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1
