will go back next trip out 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
excellent product 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
excellent product 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i wont be back 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i love it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
how awesome is that 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worthwhile 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
better than new 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
very displeased 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
go watch it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
that was nice 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
excellent product 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
cool phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this place is great 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
great charger 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
never going back 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i love it 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
love it great armband 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
excellent short film 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great phone 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
better than new 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
either way it sucks 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
great bluetooth 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
cool phone 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
everything is appalling 0 
great bluetooth 1 
great movie 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this place is great 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
that was nice 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
good servicecheck 1 
great phone 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the battery works great 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the battery works great 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not enough volume 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
go watch it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
warning do not buy 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
that was nice 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0

the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
crisp and clear 1 
great sound and service 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1
