i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
works great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
worthwhile 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
no real improvement 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great phone 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
will be back again 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
very displeased 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
its a great item 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great charger 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
will be back again 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
will be back again 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
cool phone 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
great phone 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
warning do not buy 0 
great product 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
great bluetooth 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
better than new 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
worst phone ever 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
love it great armband 1 
great phone 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
not my thing 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a bit predictable 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
omit watching this 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
great product 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great charger 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
worthwhile 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
brilliant 1 
go watch it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
go watch it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
that was nice 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
go watch it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
will order from them again 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
will not be back 0 
great movie 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
a great way to finish a great 1

you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
go watch it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
brilliant 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1
