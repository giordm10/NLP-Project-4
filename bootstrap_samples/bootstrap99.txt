worthwhile 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
fantastic service here 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
either way it sucks 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
good case 1 
works great 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the battery works great 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great movie 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i will not return 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
good servicecheck 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this place is great 1 
omit watching this 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
will order from them again 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i love it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
great product 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
worthwhile 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great product 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great phone 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
good case 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
how awesome is that 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i love it 1 
love it great armband 1 
never going back 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
that was nice 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
works great 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great movie 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
how awesome is that 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
a bit predictable 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
excellent short film 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not enough volume 0 
good servicecheck 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
crisp and clear 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
a bit predictable 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
omit watching this 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
will order from them again 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
poor quality and service 0 
very displeased 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i want my money back 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
worthwhile 1 
cool phone 1 
excellent short film 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
not a good bargain 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i want my money back 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
great product 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
cool phone 1 
works great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
last time buying from you 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
brilliant 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the battery works great 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
warning do not buy 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
last time buying from you 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
poor quality and service 0 
talk about useless customer service 0
