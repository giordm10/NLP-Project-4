the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
omit watching this 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
not my thing 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the battery works great 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
omit watching this 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
great phone 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
everything is appalling 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
a bit predictable 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great product 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not my thing 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
excellent product 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
go watch it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
soggy and not good 0 
fantastic service here 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great movie 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
good case 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
warning do not buy 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i wont be back 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i want my money back 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
never going back 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
will not be back 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great phone 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellent product 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0

this place is great 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
great charger 1 
great movie 1

there are some generally great things in it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
fantastic service here 1

its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
good case 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this place is great 1 
i wont be back 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1

last time buying from you 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1

nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i love it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
excellent product 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0

very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great phone 1

clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
go and see it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
love it great armband 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

thoroughly disappointed 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1

so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1

one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0

but this movie really got to me 1 
never going back 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1
