how awesome is that 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
will not be back 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i love it 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
worthwhile 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
love it great armband 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great charger 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
its a great item 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
works great 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
will order from them again 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
fantastic service here 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
fantastic service here 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
not a good bargain 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i wont be back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
go watch it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great sound and service 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
no real improvement 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
excellent product 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
crisp and clear 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its a great item 1 
works great 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
dont do it 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
better than new 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
worthwhile 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
dont do it 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i wont be back 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
brilliant 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1

the film looks cheap and bland 0 
brilliant 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
brilliant 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
that was nice 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not enough volume 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great product 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i love it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this place is great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1

cool phone 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

great phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0

does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1

i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1

if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this place is great 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0
