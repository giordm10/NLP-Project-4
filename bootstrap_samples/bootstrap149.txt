thank you for such great service 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
brilliant 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
not my thing 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its a great item 1 
very displeased 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great phone 1 
how awesome is that 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
will order from them again 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i wont be back 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i love it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
worthwhile 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
not a good bargain 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
not enough volume 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
good case 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this place has it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
soggy and not good 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i will not return 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i love it 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
excellent product 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great bluetooth 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not enough volume 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
love it great armband 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
will not be back 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great phone 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
excellent short film 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
warning do not buy 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
will not be back 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
great movie 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
omit watching this 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
cool phone 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
excellent short film 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
good servicecheck 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
its a great item 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i wont be back 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
service sucks 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

last time buying from you 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
good transmit audio 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
great phone 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i will not return 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
dont do it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
worthwhile 1 
good case 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this place has it 1 
worthwhile 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wont be back 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
either way it sucks 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
a bit predictable 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
better than new 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
good servicecheck 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1
