theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
crisp and clear 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
never going back 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i will not return 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
warning do not buy 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i wont be back 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
go watch it 1 
good case 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
soggy and not good 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
good servicecheck 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the battery works great 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place has it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not my thing 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellent product 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
love it great armband 1 
great product 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
that was nice 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
will order from them again 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
worthwhile 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
never going back 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great product 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
fantastic service here 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
great sound and service 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
poor quality and service 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great charger 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
never going back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
that was nice 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great product 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i will not return 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
dont do it 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great product 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
will not be back 0 
not my thing 0 
works great 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
will not be back 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
good case 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great charger 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
how awesome is that 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
great bluetooth 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
warning do not buy 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
good transmit audio 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great movie 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i want my money back 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great sound and service 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
not enough volume 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
cool phone 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1
