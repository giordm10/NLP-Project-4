three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
everything is appalling 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1

everything is appalling 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1

i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1

the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0

the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
sauce was tasteless 0

not a good bargain 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0

even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i wont be back 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1

excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

great bluetooth 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
brilliant 1

please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great phone 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
either way it sucks 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0

the rest of the cast also play well 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the battery works great 1 
great phone 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0

protects the phone on all sides 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this place is great 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
no real improvement 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1

give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
great sound and service 1

buy a different phone but not this 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great phone 1 
not my thing 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1

i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1

everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1

great sound and service 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1

the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
last time buying from you 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the battery works great 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great phone 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i wont be back 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this place has it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1

the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
soggy and not good 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
not my thing 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
last time buying from you 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0
