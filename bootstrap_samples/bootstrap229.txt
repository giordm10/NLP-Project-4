it didnt charge for me 0 
i wont be back 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
brilliant 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this place is great 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
great sound and service 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
will not be back 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
never going back 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great charger 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
will order from them again 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
not enough volume 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
very displeased 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
poor quality and service 0 
its a great item 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the battery works great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i wont be back 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i wont be back 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great movie 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i wont be back 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
better than new 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
brilliant 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
works great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0

the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the battery works great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
soggy and not good 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
go and see it 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
warning do not buy 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
cool phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great charger 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great sound and service 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this place is great 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1

plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
excellent product 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
worthwhile 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
cool phone 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
service sucks 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
fantastic service here 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i love it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
poor quality and service 0 
everything is appalling 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great bluetooth 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
everything is appalling 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1
