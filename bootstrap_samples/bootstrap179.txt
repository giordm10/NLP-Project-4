thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
no real improvement 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
everything is appalling 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wont be back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
excellent product 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
great sound and service 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
that was nice 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
works great 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
cool phone 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
last time buying from you 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i love it 1 
fantastic service here 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
really really good rice all the time 1

service sucks 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
poor quality and service 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i love it 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i want my money back 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this place is great 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0

a bit predictable 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
a bit predictable 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
go watch it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
a bit predictable 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
go watch it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
worthwhile 1 
will not be back 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great movie 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0

dont waste your money and time 0 
great bluetooth 1 
excellent product 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent short film 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
brilliant 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
better than new 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
great charger 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this place has it 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not my thing 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i want my money back 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
works great 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
works great 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
excellent product 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
go watch it 1 
will order from them again 1 
i wont be back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0
