never going back 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
works great 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
not my thing 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this place is great 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
will not be back 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not a good bargain 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
its a great item 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this place is great 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
excellent product 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
everything is appalling 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this place is great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
brilliant 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i want my money back 0 
brilliant 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i will not return 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
never going back 0 
great product 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0

the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i will not return 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not enough volume 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
will order from them again 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
crisp and clear 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
last time buying from you 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i love it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1

i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
great sound and service 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0

the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great sound and service 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
dont do it 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
great product 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worthwhile 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
not my thing 0 
go and see it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this place is great 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
good case 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
works great 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
good case 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i want my money back 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
that was nice 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1
