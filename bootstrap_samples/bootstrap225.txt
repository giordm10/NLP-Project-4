this place has it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
last time buying from you 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
either way it sucks 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
poor quality and service 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i want my money back 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
crisp and clear 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great charger 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great sound and service 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

will order from them again 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
either way it sucks 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
last time buying from you 0

it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great phone 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
never going back 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place has it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
a bit predictable 0 
go watch it 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
how awesome is that 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great charger 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
not a good bargain 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
better than new 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

all three broke within two months of use 0 
brilliant 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
go watch it 1 
great charger 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i wont be back 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
brilliant 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1

good servicecheck 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

definitely a bargain 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i love it 1

conclusion i loved it 1 
great phone 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
bacon is hella salty 1

this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
cool phone 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0

the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
everything is appalling 0 
will be back again 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1

we loved the biscuits 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellent short film 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
cool phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0

sauce was tasteless 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
good case 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1

never going back 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
very displeased 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0

i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0
