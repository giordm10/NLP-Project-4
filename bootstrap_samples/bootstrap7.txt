also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
love it great armband 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great product 1 
not my thing 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
will order from them again 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
either way it sucks 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
how awesome is that 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i wont be back 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
love it great armband 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great movie 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
good case 1 
worst phone ever 0 
not my thing 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i wont be back 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
soggy and not good 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
dont do it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the battery works great 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
that was nice 1 
i will not return 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its a great item 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
excellent product 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
last time buying from you 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
will be back again 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
excellent product 1 
great product 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i want my money back 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
not my thing 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
brilliant 1 
good case 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1

i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
worst phone ever 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
not enough volume 0 
good case 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
excellent short film 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

great phone 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
its a great item 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very displeased 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
excellent short film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
great bluetooth 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
never going back 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great sound and service 1

its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
poor quality and service 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

the battery works great 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great phone 1 
i want my money back 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
cool phone 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
better than new 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0

great phone 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
excellent product 1 
great bluetooth 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0
