this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great movie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
crisp and clear 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
better than new 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
soggy and not good 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
brilliant 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
great bluetooth 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
will not be back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
good servicecheck 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
works great 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
poor quality and service 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
cool phone 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
excellent short film 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great product 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
love it great armband 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
love it great armband 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i wont be back 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
brilliant 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
excellent short film 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the battery works great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
excellent product 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
great movie 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
love it great armband 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
brilliant 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
worthwhile 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
not my thing 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
go watch it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
cool phone 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0

if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1

the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this place is great 1 
excellent short film 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i will not return 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
worst phone ever 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
worthwhile 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
last time buying from you 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not my thing 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
worst phone ever 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
good case 1 
will order from them again 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
everything is appalling 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
its a great item 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this place is great 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1
