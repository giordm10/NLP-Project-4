good servicecheck 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not a good bargain 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
worthwhile 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
worthwhile 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
fantastic service here 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
good servicecheck 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this place is great 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the battery works great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i wont be back 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
will be back again 1 
worthwhile 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great product 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i will not return 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
will not be back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
last time buying from you 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great product 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
go watch it 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
last time buying from you 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
will not be back 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
never going back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
either way it sucks 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i will not return 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great phone 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this place has it 1 
good case 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
will not be back 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its a great item 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not enough volume 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great charger 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
no real improvement 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
fantastic service here 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this place has it 1 
that was nice 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great movie 1 
warning do not buy 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
last time buying from you 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
not a good bargain 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
go and see it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
brilliant 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great bluetooth 1 
love it great armband 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
fantastic service here 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
warning do not buy 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
go watch it 1 
will order from them again 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0

as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i definitly recommend 1
