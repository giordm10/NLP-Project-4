much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not my thing 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i love it 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i wont be back 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
excellent product 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
service sucks 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
will not be back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
brilliant 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
fantastic service here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great phone 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
that was nice 1 
i love it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
go and see it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
not a good bargain 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
no real improvement 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
not my thing 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
a bit predictable 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
excellent product 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
works great 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
brilliant 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this place is great 1 
will order from them again 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
its a great item 1 
love it great armband 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not enough volume 0 
dont do it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
brilliant 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this place has it 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
great movie 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great movie 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
love it great armband 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
never going back 0 
i will not return 0 
worst phone ever 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this place has it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
no real improvement 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
no real improvement 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i will not return 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
better than new 1 
good transmit audio 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1

conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
fantastic service here 1 
worst phone ever 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i love it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0

but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
will not be back 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great sound and service 1 
love it great armband 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
how awesome is that 1 
this place has it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
poor quality and service 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i love it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
no real improvement 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0
