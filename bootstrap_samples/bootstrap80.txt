i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i will not return 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
service sucks 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
warning do not buy 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
not a good bargain 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i will not return 0 
i wont be back 0 
go and see it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worst phone ever 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
everything is appalling 0 
great phone 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
this place has it 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
not a good bargain 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
dont do it 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
soggy and not good 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
no real improvement 0 
works great 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
excellent short film 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
will not be back 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1

technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
not enough volume 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
not my thing 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
works great 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
worst phone ever 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
not my thing 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
service sucks 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
not enough volume 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i will not return 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great product 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great bluetooth 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
not a good bargain 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
great product 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
will order from them again 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1

this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
cool phone 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great phone 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0
