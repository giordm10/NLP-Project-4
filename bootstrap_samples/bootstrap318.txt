great pizza and salads 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
no real improvement 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
not a good bargain 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
good servicecheck 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
its a great item 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
worst phone ever 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
works great 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
its a great item 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
works great 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
soggy and not good 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
works great 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
that was nice 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
cool phone 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
that was nice 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellent product 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
last time buying from you 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
good transmit audio 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
brilliant 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
will be back again 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
last time buying from you 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great movie 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
cool phone 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
not enough volume 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i wont be back 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
good transmit audio 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
service sucks 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great phone 1 
excellent short film 1 
great charger 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not enough volume 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
dont do it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great phone 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i love it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great phone 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
excellent product 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
excellent short film 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this place has it 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i love it 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
better than new 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
go and see it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i want my money back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
will be back again 1 
great phone 1 
great bluetooth 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
good servicecheck 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
great phone 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
works great 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
great product 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i will not return 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1
