it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great movie 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1

the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

the item received was counterfeit 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
that one didnt work either 0

every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great product 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i love it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the lighting is awful 0

this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1

very displeased 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0

i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
very displeased 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great product 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
service sucks 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
great product 1 
not a good bargain 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
cool phone 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
no real improvement 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
either way it sucks 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
service sucks 0 
excellent product 1 
warning do not buy 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this place has it 1 
the battery works great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
crisp and clear 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
go watch it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
that was nice 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
cool phone 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this place is great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
worthwhile 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
never going back 0

this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
good servicecheck 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1

there are some generally great things in it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this place is great 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
poor quality and service 0

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
everything is appalling 0 
warning do not buy 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
works great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
will not be back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1

we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
cool phone 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
its a great item 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
not enough volume 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
last time buying from you 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0
