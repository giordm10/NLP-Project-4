ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
better than new 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0

this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0

she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
excellent short film 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i love it 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1

its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
good case 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0

the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1

one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1

i will not return 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0

it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
great bluetooth 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1
