this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
great phone 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
its a great item 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
a bit predictable 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
fantastic service here 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this place is great 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
good case 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
omit watching this 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
cool phone 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
excellent short film 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i wont be back 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
omit watching this 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
last time buying from you 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
good case 1 
a bit predictable 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0

service was slow and not attentive 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
love it great armband 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
good case 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
will be back again 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this place has it 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great phone 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this place is great 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
omit watching this 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
go watch it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great product 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
service sucks 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
will be back again 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this place is great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
great movie 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great bluetooth 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
cool phone 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
excellent product 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

awkward to use and unreliable 0 
great phone 1 
great product 1 
great sound and service 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
brilliant 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
go and see it 1 
good transmit audio 1 
its a great item 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i love it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
go watch it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1

tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i want my money back 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
either way it sucks 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
good servicecheck 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellent product 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
excellent product 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
basically the service was very bad 0
