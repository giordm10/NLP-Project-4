buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the battery works great 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this place is great 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
fantastic service here 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
great movie 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
love it great armband 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
fantastic service here 1 
will not be back 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great sound and service 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this place has it 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
will order from them again 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great movie 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
either way it sucks 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1

the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
better than new 1 
will order from them again 1

i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wont be back 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great phone 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
omit watching this 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not a good bargain 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
fantastic service here 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
not my thing 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great sound and service 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
that was nice 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
its a great item 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i wont be back 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
that was nice 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
go watch it 1 
brilliant 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great phone 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
go watch it 1 
great charger 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great phone 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i love it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent short film 1 
never going back 0 
great phone 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great phone 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
good servicecheck 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i will not return 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its a great item 1 
not a good bargain 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
crisp and clear 1 
not my thing 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
that was nice 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1

so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
works great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
soggy and not good 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
worst phone ever 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
will not be back 0 
go and see it 1 
this place is great 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0
