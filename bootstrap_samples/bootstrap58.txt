the commercials are the most misleading 0 
excellent product 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1

great for using with your home stereo 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0

either way it sucks 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
go watch it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
good transmit audio 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

great sound and service 1 
bacon is hella salty 1

if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
never going back 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1

based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
great product 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0

there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
will order from them again 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great product 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent product 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0

an excellent performance from ms 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
worthwhile 1 
i wont be back 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
great bluetooth 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
warning do not buy 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
excellent product 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
last time buying from you 0 
good case 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
love the margaritas too 1

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i love it 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1

the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0
