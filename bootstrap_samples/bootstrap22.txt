this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
brilliant 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great charger 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
brilliant 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i will not return 0 
never going back 0 
everything is appalling 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
excellent product 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
dont do it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
service sucks 0 
better than new 1 
i wont be back 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i love it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
excellent product 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
cool phone 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
how awesome is that 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i wont be back 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
omit watching this 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
will be back again 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
omit watching this 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i wont be back 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
excellent short film 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
worst phone ever 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
good transmit audio 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
last time buying from you 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
crisp and clear 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
how awesome is that 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great sound and service 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
good case 1 
not enough volume 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
go watch it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i will not return 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
how awesome is that 1 
that was nice 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1

everything is appalling 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not my thing 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
crisp and clear 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
no real improvement 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
no real improvement 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
service sucks 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
will not be back 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
either way it sucks 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
very displeased 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1

an excellent performance from ms 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
soggy and not good 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0

excellent short film 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
cool phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1
