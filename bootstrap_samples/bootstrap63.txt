but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
not my thing 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a bit predictable 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i wont be back 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
great charger 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
that was nice 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
not enough volume 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i want my money back 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
never going back 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
service sucks 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
its a great item 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
never going back 0 
go watch it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
good transmit audio 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
never going back 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great movie 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great phone 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
brilliant 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
works great 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
good case 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
dont do it 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
good case 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i want my money back 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
good case 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellent product 1 
soggy and not good 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
excellent short film 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
cool phone 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
cool phone 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
its a great item 1

the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

this is a stunning movie 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
love the margaritas too 1

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
crisp and clear 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1

if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1

please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0

the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0

if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the lighting is awful 0

the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0

and the drinks are weak people 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1

it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
never going back 0

i gave it a 10 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0

i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great charger 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
but then they came back cold 0

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1
