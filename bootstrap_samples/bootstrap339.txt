i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
that was nice 1 
will not be back 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
everything is appalling 0 
its a great item 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
will order from them again 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great product 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
no real improvement 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
good case 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
omit watching this 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great sound and service 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
better than new 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
not my thing 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
worst phone ever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
not my thing 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
service sucks 0 
poor quality and service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not enough volume 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
never going back 0 
great sound and service 1 
last time buying from you 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
will be back again 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
never going back 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
good case 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0

it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

poor quality and service 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1

ive had better atmosphere 0 
love it great armband 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i love it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
love it great armband 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
worthwhile 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
excellent product 1

the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1

they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
love it great armband 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
great product 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
great product 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
good case 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
that was nice 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this is not moviemaking 0

great sound and service 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
great product 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0

angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
crisp and clear 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
great phone 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i great reception all the time 1

it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
a bit predictable 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this place has it 1
