excellent short film 1 
great bluetooth 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great charger 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great product 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great phone 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
brilliant 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
everything is appalling 0 
excellent product 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
love it great armband 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
soggy and not good 0 
that was nice 1 
that was nice 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
love it great armband 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
how awesome is that 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
love it great armband 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i want my money back 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great charger 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
good case 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
worthwhile 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
love it great armband 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great phone 1 
the battery works great 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
will order from them again 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great phone 1 
worthwhile 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i want my money back 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
crisp and clear 1 
go watch it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great product 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
omit watching this 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
go and see it 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i wont be back 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
not enough volume 0 
great phone 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i love it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
will not be back 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
will order from them again 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
warning do not buy 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great sound and service 1 
excellent product 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
not enough volume 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
will order from them again 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
never going back 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great bluetooth 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i love it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this place has it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
no real improvement 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i wont be back 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
worthwhile 1 
the battery works great 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
go watch it 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
everything is appalling 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
a bit predictable 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
not my thing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
dont do it 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
will be back again 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
crisp and clear 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
excellent short film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i wont be back 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the battery works great 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0
