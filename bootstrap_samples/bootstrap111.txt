this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i want my money back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great movie 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
no real improvement 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the battery works great 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
not my thing 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
that was nice 1 
that was nice 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great product 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
worst phone ever 0 
that was nice 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i love it 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
go watch it 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
works great 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
excellent short film 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
will order from them again 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great product 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
excellent short film 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
soggy and not good 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worthwhile 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great phone 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
works great 1 
not enough volume 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
cool phone 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
excellent product 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
last time buying from you 0 
how awesome is that 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
poor quality and service 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great charger 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0

this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
cool phone 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this place has it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great product 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
will not be back 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
go watch it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
will not be back 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
will order from them again 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
not my thing 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this place has it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
omit watching this 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
poor quality and service 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
not a good bargain 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great phone 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
better than new 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
brilliant 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great bluetooth 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
excellent product 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1
