the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1

ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1

the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

good servicecheck 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0

its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

thoroughly disappointed 0 
great charger 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0

i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0

this place has it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
not a good bargain 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1

the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
its a great item 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
good servicecheck 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0

great phone 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this place has it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great pizza and salads 1

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
omit watching this 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
no real improvement 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0
