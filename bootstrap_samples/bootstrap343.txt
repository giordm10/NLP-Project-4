its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i want my money back 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i will not return 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
better than new 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
dont do it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
great movie 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i will not return 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
poor quality and service 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
better than new 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
works great 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i want my money back 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
soggy and not good 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
great product 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i wont be back 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
go and see it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
never going back 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i love it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
great movie 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
everything is appalling 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
great movie 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
love it great armband 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
service sucks 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
how awesome is that 1 
very displeased 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
poor quality and service 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1

this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
a bit predictable 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0

i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0

great for using with your home stereo 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
a bit predictable 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1

great phone 1 
this place is great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
very displeased 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
better than new 1
