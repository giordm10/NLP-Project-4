not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
crisp and clear 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i wont be back 0 
poor quality and service 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
not my thing 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i will not return 0 
its a great item 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
not enough volume 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i wont be back 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
love it great armband 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this place is great 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this place is great 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not enough volume 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
not my thing 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i wont be back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
cool phone 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
worst phone ever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
good transmit audio 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
never going back 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
go and see it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1

i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
better than new 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a bit predictable 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
go and see it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great product 1 
will order from them again 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
that was nice 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
dont do it 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
cool phone 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
not my thing 0 
great bluetooth 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
soggy and not good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
worthwhile 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
poor quality and service 0 
works great 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
go and see it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great movie 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
a bit predictable 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i wont be back 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
last time buying from you 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
good transmit audio 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this place is great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the battery works great 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
good transmit audio 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
never going back 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
not a good bargain 0 
not my thing 0 
a bit predictable 0
