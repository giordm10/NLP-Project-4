the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
better than new 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i wont be back 0 
i want my money back 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
very displeased 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great phone 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
worst phone ever 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
either way it sucks 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not my thing 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
excellent product 1 
everything is appalling 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
not my thing 0 
great charger 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
no real improvement 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
its a great item 1 
its a great item 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
brilliant 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
a bit predictable 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
fantastic service here 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i wont be back 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great sound and service 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
will order from them again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
soggy and not good 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great movie 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
cool phone 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
will not be back 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
not a good bargain 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
excellent product 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great phone 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
not my thing 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
its a great item 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
a bit predictable 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great movie 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good transmit audio 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
service sucks 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
last time buying from you 0 
its a great item 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
great product 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
good case 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
will not be back 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
talk about useless customer service 0

dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the battery works great 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
great bluetooth 1 
good case 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
how awesome is that 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
better than new 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1
