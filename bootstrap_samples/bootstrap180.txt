i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
great charger 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
good servicecheck 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
omit watching this 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
good servicecheck 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
excellent short film 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
service sucks 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
dont do it 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
poor quality and service 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
better than new 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
will be back again 1 
great phone 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
will order from them again 1 
last time buying from you 0 
will not be back 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
will order from them again 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
last time buying from you 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great charger 1 
sauce was tasteless 0

google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
good case 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i wont be back 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great product 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
great phone 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
excellent short film 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great movie 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
poor quality and service 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i will not return 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
poor quality and service 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent product 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
go and see it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
either way it sucks 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great phone 1 
great phone 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
not my thing 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0

anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
brilliant 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
that was nice 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0

conclusion i loved it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1

i was hoping for more 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
soggy and not good 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i wont be back 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0

this place has it 1 
love it great armband 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1

sprint terrible customer service 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

best bluetooth on the market 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
brilliant 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1
