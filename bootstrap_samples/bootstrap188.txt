it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its a great item 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
better than new 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i want my money back 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
last time buying from you 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
good servicecheck 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
omit watching this 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
very displeased 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
love it great armband 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
love it great armband 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
great sound and service 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this place has it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
will be back again 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not enough volume 0 
excellent short film 1 
excellent product 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
go and see it 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
last time buying from you 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
works great 1 
this place has it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
worthwhile 1 
very displeased 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
excellent short film 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0

do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i love it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
will not be back 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this place has it 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
great bluetooth 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
crisp and clear 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1

the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
works great 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
very displeased 0

the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
service sucks 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1

works great 1
