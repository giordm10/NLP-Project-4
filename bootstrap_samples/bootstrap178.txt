however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
that was nice 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this place has it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
cool phone 1 
its a great item 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
either way it sucks 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
go and see it 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
good case 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
dont do it 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent short film 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
never going back 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
dont do it 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
good case 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
how awesome is that 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
no real improvement 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
worthwhile 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great product 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
will be back again 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
better than new 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
fantastic service here 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
dont do it 0 
go watch it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1

i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1

not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0

great movie 1 
either way it sucks 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
works great 1

excellent product for the price 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0

that was nice 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
works great 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0
