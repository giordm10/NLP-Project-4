this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
how awesome is that 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1

real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
great phone 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
crisp and clear 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
crisp and clear 1 
its a great item 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
crisp and clear 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
go and see it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
very displeased 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i want my money back 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this place is great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
brilliant 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
that was nice 1 
excellent product 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
soggy and not good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i want my money back 0 
the battery works great 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
will be back again 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
warning do not buy 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
good servicecheck 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
will not be back 0 
this place has it 1 
i want my money back 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
not my thing 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
excellent product 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i love it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
cool phone 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
very displeased 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
great charger 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0

they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
not my thing 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worthwhile 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
will be back again 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0

our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
soggy and not good 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
worthwhile 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
either way it sucks 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0

this one just fails to create any real suspense 0

that one didnt work either 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
not my thing 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1

warning do not buy 0

go and see it 1 
go watch it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0
