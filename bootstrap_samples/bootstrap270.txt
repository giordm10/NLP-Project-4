now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i will not return 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
not my thing 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i love it 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
warning do not buy 0 
will be back again 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i want my money back 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
better than new 1 
omit watching this 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
good servicecheck 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
not enough volume 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great charger 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
soggy and not good 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
great bluetooth 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
excellent short film 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great phone 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
not my thing 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not a good bargain 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
service sucks 0 
worthwhile 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
will be back again 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
not my thing 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this place is great 1 
how awesome is that 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a bit predictable 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
good case 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
a bit predictable 0 
i wont be back 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
great phone 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great charger 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
very displeased 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great phone 1 
this place has it 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
good transmit audio 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
not my thing 0 
brilliant 1 
go watch it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
excellent short film 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this place is great 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this place has it 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0
