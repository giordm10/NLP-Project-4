i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great movie 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
brilliant 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
will not be back 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this place is great 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
not enough volume 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
works great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
better than new 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
will be back again 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0

i gave it a 10 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
that was nice 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the battery works great 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
either way it sucks 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
great phone 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
works great 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i wont be back 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great charger 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
love it great armband 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
will order from them again 1 
excellent product 1 
its a great item 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
not enough volume 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
brilliant 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the battery works great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
great sound and service 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
soggy and not good 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i wont be back 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
excellent product 1 
this place is great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its a great item 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
good case 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
go watch it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
great sound and service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
omit watching this 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i want my money back 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
not a good bargain 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
that was nice 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
very displeased 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
great charger 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was hoping for more 0

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
excellent product 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1

she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent product 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great charger 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very displeased 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
no real improvement 0
