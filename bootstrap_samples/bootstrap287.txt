a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
omit watching this 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i want my money back 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
omit watching this 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
will be back again 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
either way it sucks 0 
omit watching this 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
a bit predictable 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
no real improvement 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
great sound and service 1 
will order from them again 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great charger 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
service sucks 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
will order from them again 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i love it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
that was nice 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
that was nice 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
everything is appalling 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
very displeased 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
warning do not buy 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the battery works great 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i love it 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
will be back again 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
good case 1 
not a good bargain 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
crisp and clear 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
crisp and clear 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
good transmit audio 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
fantastic service here 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great product 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the battery works great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
last time buying from you 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
service sucks 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the battery works great 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
brilliant 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
soggy and not good 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
never going back 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i want my money back 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
service sucks 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
worst phone ever 0 
excellent product 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
brilliant 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
warning do not buy 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
excellent short film 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
everything is appalling 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wont be back 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1

the lighting is awful 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
will not be back 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1
