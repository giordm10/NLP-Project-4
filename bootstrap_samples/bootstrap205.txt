if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1

the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
good case 1 
the battery works great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
better than new 1 
fantastic service here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
will be back again 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
poor quality and service 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
warning do not buy 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
will order from them again 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
very displeased 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this place is great 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
dont do it 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
crisp and clear 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
how awesome is that 1 
great product 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great movie 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
service sucks 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
cool phone 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
poor quality and service 0 
brilliant 1 
very displeased 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great bluetooth 1 
not enough volume 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i want my money back 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
works great 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
service sucks 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
crisp and clear 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
its a great item 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
will be back again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
never going back 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
good servicecheck 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great charger 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
better than new 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
omit watching this 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
omit watching this 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
go watch it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its a great item 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great phone 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
omit watching this 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
not enough volume 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0
