service was slow and not attentive 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
good transmit audio 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great phone 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
great product 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
not enough volume 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
will be back again 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great phone 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
warning do not buy 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great movie 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
go and see it 1 
very displeased 0 
excellent short film 1 
its a great item 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not a good bargain 0 
excellent product 1 
dont do it 0 
will be back again 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great sound and service 1 
worst phone ever 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great charger 1 
its a great item 1 
i want my money back 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great movie 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
poor quality and service 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
better than new 1 
great phone 1 
worthwhile 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
worthwhile 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
never going back 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great phone 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
never going back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
soggy and not good 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
great movie 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
works great 1 
will be back again 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1

poor quality and service 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
excellent product 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
will order from them again 1 
love it great armband 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
crisp and clear 1

avoid at all cost 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
never going back 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
good case 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
worst phone ever 0

i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this place is great 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
service sucks 0

virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellent product 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
that was nice 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
go and see it 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great charger 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
better than new 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
excellent product 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
last time buying from you 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
will order from them again 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i wont be back 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1
