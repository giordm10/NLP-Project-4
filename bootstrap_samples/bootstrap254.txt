i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
works great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
will not be back 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
soggy and not good 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i wont be back 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great movie 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i wont be back 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this place has it 1 
not enough volume 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i will not return 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
poor quality and service 0 
excellent product 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
will not be back 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this place is great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
service sucks 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1

that was nice 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
very displeased 0 
excellent product 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not a good bargain 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
poor quality and service 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
cool phone 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
not a good bargain 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great bluetooth 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i love it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not my thing 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
will be back again 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
service sucks 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
good transmit audio 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
works great 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
better than new 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
fantastic service here 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great phone 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i want my money back 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great phone 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great bluetooth 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

love it great armband 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great charger 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
good case 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i want my money back 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
will order from them again 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
go and see it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
poor quality and service 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
will be back again 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
go and see it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
great phone 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
great sound and service 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0

this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0
