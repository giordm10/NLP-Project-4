in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this place has it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
good transmit audio 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
not a good bargain 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
will order from them again 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
warning do not buy 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
soggy and not good 0 
better than new 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
that was nice 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
excellent product 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great sound and service 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
everything is appalling 0 
not enough volume 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i will not return 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
fantastic service here 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
worthwhile 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
worthwhile 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this place has it 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great charger 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
excellent short film 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this place is great 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great phone 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
will not be back 0 
love it great armband 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great sound and service 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
love it great armband 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
good transmit audio 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
soggy and not good 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
last time buying from you 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
great product 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
no real improvement 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
never going back 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
will order from them again 1 
great phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
brilliant 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
love it great armband 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
fantastic service here 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
everything is appalling 0 
great phone 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1

its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i wont be back 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
last time buying from you 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i want my money back 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this place is great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1
