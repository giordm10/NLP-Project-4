one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
will be back again 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great bluetooth 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1

cool phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i wont be back 0 
not my thing 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
brilliant 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great product 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i will not return 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i want my money back 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great phone 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
will order from them again 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
a bit predictable 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1

i had to purchase a different case 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
how awesome is that 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
great phone 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
a bit predictable 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its a great item 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great charger 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
great sound and service 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
great phone 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the battery works great 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
soggy and not good 0 
that was nice 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
good servicecheck 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
cool phone 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
better than new 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

that was nice 1 
i want my money back 0 
not enough volume 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i love it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the battery works great 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
no real improvement 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
better than new 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
a bit predictable 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the battery works great 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its a great item 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not enough volume 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great sound and service 1 
excellent short film 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
worthwhile 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
good servicecheck 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
worthwhile 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
a bit predictable 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
either way it sucks 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
cool phone 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
will not be back 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
works great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
not my thing 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
no real improvement 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0
