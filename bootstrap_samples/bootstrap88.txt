i will not return 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
service sucks 0 
never going back 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
brilliant 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i love it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
great product 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not my thing 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
omit watching this 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i want my money back 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
excellent product 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
no real improvement 0 
great phone 1 
great movie 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
dont do it 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
very displeased 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
its a great item 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
fantastic service here 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
omit watching this 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worthwhile 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the battery works great 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
better than new 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the battery works great 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
not a good bargain 0 
brilliant 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i want my money back 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
will not be back 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
will order from them again 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont do it 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this place has it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
how awesome is that 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellent product 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
will not be back 0 
i will not return 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
crisp and clear 1 
works great 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
good case 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
excellent short film 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
excellent product 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
very displeased 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
not a good bargain 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
will be back again 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
crisp and clear 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
love it great armband 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the battery works great 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
brilliant 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
cool phone 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
will order from them again 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this place has it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1
