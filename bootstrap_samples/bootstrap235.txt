i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
cool phone 1 
great movie 1 
worst phone ever 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1

i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this place has it 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
a bit predictable 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0

excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
that was nice 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1

its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great bluetooth 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this place has it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
warning do not buy 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
either way it sucks 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1

at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i wont be back 0 
good case 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i love it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
better than new 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
love it great armband 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
service sucks 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
how awesome is that 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

all three broke within two months of use 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
great movie 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
everything is appalling 0

overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1

the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
go watch it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0

protects the phone on all sides 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
a bit predictable 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0

i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the battery works great 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1

and then tragedy struck 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
poor quality and service 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
love it great armband 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
will be back again 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
never going back 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
everything is appalling 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
last time buying from you 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
works great 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
will go back next trip out 1

i want my money back 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
brilliant 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0
