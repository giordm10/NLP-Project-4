our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
that was nice 1 
very displeased 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
brilliant 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
soggy and not good 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
excellent short film 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
will be back again 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great bluetooth 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i love it 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
worthwhile 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
no real improvement 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great charger 1 
i love it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great phone 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the battery works great 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1

sprint terrible customer service 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
a bit predictable 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
excellent short film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
great charger 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
love it great armband 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
worst phone ever 0 
service sucks 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
works great 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
everything is appalling 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great movie 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
excellent short film 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
that was nice 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
brilliant 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
omit watching this 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
good case 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0

every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1

a great way to finish a great 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0
