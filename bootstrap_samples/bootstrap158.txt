i came out of it feeling angry 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
omit watching this 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
go and see it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great sound and service 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
brilliant 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this place has it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
works great 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this place is great 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a bit predictable 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i wont be back 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
crisp and clear 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
service sucks 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
never going back 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
brilliant 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worthwhile 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
excellent short film 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
good case 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great bluetooth 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
how awesome is that 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
crisp and clear 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
not enough volume 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great movie 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
good case 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
dont do it 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
warning do not buy 0 
very displeased 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i will not return 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the battery works great 1 
i will not return 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
will be back again 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
go watch it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this place is great 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
service sucks 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
poor quality and service 0 
service sucks 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
omit watching this 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
good case 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
great movie 1 
worthwhile 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the battery works great 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i want my money back 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i will not return 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this place is great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place has it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1
