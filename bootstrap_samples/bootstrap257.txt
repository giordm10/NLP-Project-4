everything is appalling 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great phone 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i want my money back 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
no real improvement 0 
works great 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
soggy and not good 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
service sucks 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
no real improvement 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
go watch it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
everything is appalling 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
omit watching this 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
great phone 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i will not return 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
will not be back 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
great phone 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
good servicecheck 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
love it great armband 1 
that was nice 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
good transmit audio 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
warning do not buy 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i love it 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
dont do it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
not enough volume 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent short film 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
how awesome is that 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i love it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great charger 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
not a good bargain 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
last time buying from you 0 
not my thing 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
fantastic service here 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
poor quality and service 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
service sucks 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the battery works great 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great product 1 
good servicecheck 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
good servicecheck 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
its a great item 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0

ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
no real improvement 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
worst phone ever 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
good transmit audio 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great charger 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1

it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great phone 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
go watch it 1 
excellent product 1 
better than new 1 
its a great item 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
last time buying from you 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i love it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
good servicecheck 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not my thing 0 
good case 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
omit watching this 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
soggy and not good 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i wont be back 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0
