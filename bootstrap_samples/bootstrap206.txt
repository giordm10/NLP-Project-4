this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
will not be back 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
dont do it 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
works great 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
good transmit audio 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
that was nice 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

but this movie really got to me 1 
good transmit audio 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1

the atmosphere here is fun 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
not enough volume 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
poor quality and service 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1

not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
soggy and not good 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not a good bargain 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
dont do it 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
better than new 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great phone 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this place has it 1 
the battery works great 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
not enough volume 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
either way it sucks 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its a great item 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i wont be back 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
fantastic service here 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
service sucks 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great phone 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
worthwhile 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
will be back again 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
will order from them again 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
will be back again 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
love it great armband 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
very displeased 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i will not return 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
fantastic service here 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
will be back again 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0

buy a different phone but not this 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
works great 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1

as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its a great item 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
last time buying from you 0

if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great sound and service 1 
last time buying from you 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great bluetooth 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0
