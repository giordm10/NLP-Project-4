display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not my thing 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1

this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
excellent product for the price 1

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this place is great 1 
good servicecheck 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0

it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great bluetooth 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i wont be back 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1

ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i will not return 0 
last time buying from you 0 
very displeased 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great charger 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great product 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i wont be back 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0

this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
cool phone 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great bluetooth 1 
service sucks 0 
great sound and service 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
dont do it 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
dont do it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
very displeased 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
warning do not buy 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
warning do not buy 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great phone 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
go watch it 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i want my money back 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
love it great armband 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0

he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1

the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1

google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
that one didnt work either 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0
