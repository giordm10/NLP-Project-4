the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
how awesome is that 1

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i could not recommend these more 0

great bluetooth 1

great for using with your home stereo 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
will not be back 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
everything is appalling 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great bluetooth 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great movie 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
what a big waste of time 0

tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
will not be back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1

the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1

either way it sucks 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
poor quality and service 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
great phone 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the battery works great 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
great bluetooth 1 
crisp and clear 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
fantastic service here 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
service sucks 0 
no real improvement 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great movie 1 
will not be back 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1

this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
service sucks 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
soggy and not good 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the battery works great 1 
great movie 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
works great 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
good transmit audio 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this place is great 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
excellent short film 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0

no real improvement 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
good case 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
its a great item 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i could not recommend these more 0

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
crisp and clear 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i will not return 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0

director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
very displeased 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i wont be back 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
never going back 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0

great sound and service 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i love it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
brilliant 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

and the drinks are weak people 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0

its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
no real improvement 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
not my thing 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great movie 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1
