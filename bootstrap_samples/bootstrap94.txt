poor quality and service 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
great phone 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
go and see it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
good transmit audio 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i wont be back 0 
great product 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
very displeased 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
go and see it 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
will not be back 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great phone 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i want my money back 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
love it great armband 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
excellent product 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i will not return 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
not enough volume 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
love it great armband 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellent short film 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
excellent product 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
love it great armband 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
brilliant 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
worst phone ever 0 
basically the service was very bad 0

excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this place has it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
excellent product 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
its a great item 1 
how awesome is that 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

crisp and clear 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great product 1 
love it great armband 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

i love it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great charger 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
that was nice 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i will not return 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
dont do it 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this place has it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
good transmit audio 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great charger 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great movie 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this place is great 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1
