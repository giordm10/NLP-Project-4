needless to say i wasted my money 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
omit watching this 0 
i will not return 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
better than new 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great movie 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this place has it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
works great 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
not my thing 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i love it 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
not enough volume 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this place has it 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
poor quality and service 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i want my money back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
great movie 1 
worst phone ever 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
everything is appalling 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
will be back again 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i will not return 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this place is great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great sound and service 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
will order from them again 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
will be back again 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
last time buying from you 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
love it great armband 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
not my thing 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
will order from them again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
crisp and clear 1 
last time buying from you 0 
no real improvement 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i want my money back 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
no real improvement 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i love it 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
soggy and not good 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
excellent product 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
not my thing 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i wont be back 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
works great 1 
i wont be back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
works great 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i love it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
worthwhile 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
either way it sucks 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
last time buying from you 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1
