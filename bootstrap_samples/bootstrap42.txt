ive had better atmosphere 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
will be back again 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1

i will not return 0 
no real improvement 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0

overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0

the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
everything is appalling 0

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this place is great 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
good servicecheck 1

you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0

director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1

i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1

and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
omit watching this 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
no real improvement 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
good case 1

director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
cool phone 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
great movie 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1

vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1

every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i will not return 0

she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

poor quality and service 0

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0
