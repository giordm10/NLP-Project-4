the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
that was nice 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
never going back 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great phone 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
go watch it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
better than new 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i love it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
last time buying from you 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
dont do it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great sound and service 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
a bit predictable 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
great charger 1 
cool phone 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
go watch it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this place has it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great charger 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great sound and service 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this place is great 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
worst phone ever 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
better than new 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great phone 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is great 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i will not return 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great bluetooth 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
not enough volume 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
go watch it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
its a great item 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
good case 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
its a great item 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
excellent short film 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
will be back again 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
brilliant 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent product 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
will not be back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
worst phone ever 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
works great 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
not enough volume 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
works great 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
love it great armband 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
go watch it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1
