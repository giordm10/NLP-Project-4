excellent wallet type phone case 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
will order from them again 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
that was nice 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great sound and service 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the battery works great 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1

i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
brilliant 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i will not return 0 
warning do not buy 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
better than new 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
fantastic service here 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
go and see it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
last time buying from you 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
excellent short film 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
warning do not buy 0 
not my thing 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
good servicecheck 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
never going back 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
good transmit audio 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
great bluetooth 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
great sound and service 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this place has it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
fantastic service here 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
service sucks 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i want my money back 0 
everything is appalling 0 
warning do not buy 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
good servicecheck 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not my thing 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
better than new 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
brilliant 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
will not be back 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its a great item 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
love it great armband 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
service sucks 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great product 1 
good transmit audio 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0

our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0

i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great sound and service 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great charger 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0
