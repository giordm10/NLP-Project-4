i was hoping for more 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
never going back 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i love it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
worst phone ever 0 
that was nice 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
good case 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
soggy and not good 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
a bit predictable 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
works great 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
cool phone 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
not my thing 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i want my money back 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
never going back 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great charger 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
excellent product 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i will not return 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
how awesome is that 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
crisp and clear 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
not a good bargain 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i will not return 0 
good servicecheck 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
will order from them again 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this place is great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i want my money back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
brilliant 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
go watch it 1 
great sound and service 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great phone 1 
will be back again 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
worst phone ever 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
omit watching this 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i love it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
last time buying from you 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
brilliant 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great sound and service 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1

not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this place has it 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great phone 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
excellent short film 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
go and see it 1 
everything is appalling 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
no real improvement 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i will not return 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not enough volume 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
great movie 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1

we loved the biscuits 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
that was nice 1
