i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
great charger 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
that was nice 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great phone 1 
how awesome is that 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this place has it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great charger 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great phone 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wont be back 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
that was nice 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
omit watching this 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
no real improvement 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
poor quality and service 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great product 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i want my money back 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not enough volume 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
either way it sucks 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i wont be back 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
works great 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
excellent short film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
worst phone ever 0 
better than new 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
will be back again 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i will not return 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great movie 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
its a great item 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
brilliant 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
its a great item 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
great movie 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
works great 1 
will order from them again 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
go and see it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
good case 1 
go and see it 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
will order from them again 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
go watch it 1 
better than new 1 
the battery works great 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
poor quality and service 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great bluetooth 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
omit watching this 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
poor quality and service 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will not be back 0 
great movie 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great charger 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
worthwhile 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
will not be back 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
poor quality and service 0 
very displeased 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
dont do it 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this place is great 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
service sucks 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
worst phone ever 0
