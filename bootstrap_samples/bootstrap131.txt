they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
a bit predictable 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
love it great armband 1 
great product 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this place has it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
will order from them again 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
never going back 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
great phone 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
service sucks 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
cool phone 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
great sound and service 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
good case 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
very displeased 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
not my thing 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great charger 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
a bit predictable 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
good case 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
omit watching this 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
omit watching this 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
dont do it 0 
brilliant 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
no real improvement 0 
great phone 1 
its a great item 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
fantastic service here 1 
worthwhile 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
good servicecheck 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1

and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
not my thing 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
great product 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
never going back 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
cool phone 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great product 1 
good servicecheck 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

a great way to finish a great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
will be back again 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great sound and service 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
warning do not buy 0 
service sucks 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i wont be back 0 
the battery works great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
will be back again 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0
