conclusion i loved it 1 
i gave it a 10 1

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1

the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not enough volume 0

best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
excellent short film 1 
good case 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the battery works great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
excellent product 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
dont waste your money and time 0

i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
service sucks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
omit watching this 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this place has it 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
how awesome is that 1 
cool phone 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
that was nice 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
will be back again 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
worst phone ever 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i love it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
last time buying from you 0

will not be back 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
worst phone ever 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
brilliant 1 
fantastic service here 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
service sucks 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great charger 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great charger 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
warning do not buy 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i want my money back 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
good case 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
will not be back 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
poor quality and service 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0

its a great item 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0
