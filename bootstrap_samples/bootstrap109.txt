but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
that was nice 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this place is great 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i wont be back 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
that was nice 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
better than new 1 
will be back again 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
good case 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great sound and service 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1

thank you for such great service 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i love it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
great sound and service 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
better than new 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the battery works great 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
fantastic service here 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
good servicecheck 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
no real improvement 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
worthwhile 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
good case 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not my thing 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
never going back 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
soggy and not good 0 
great phone 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1

battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
warning do not buy 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its a great item 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
good servicecheck 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
will not be back 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
very displeased 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i will not return 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0

vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
last time buying from you 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

final word this show is a real torture 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0

i was hoping for more 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

excellent wallet type phone case 1 
basically the service was very bad 0
