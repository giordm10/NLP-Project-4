excellent product for the price 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
service sucks 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i love it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the battery works great 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the battery works great 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
good case 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
excellent product 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
worst phone ever 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
fantastic service here 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
not my thing 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
cool phone 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1

service was slow and not attentive 0

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
soggy and not good 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0

overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
no real improvement 0 
great bluetooth 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
either way it sucks 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great sound and service 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0

the film looks cheap and bland 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0

but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1
