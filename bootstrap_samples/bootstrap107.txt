even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the battery works great 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
very displeased 0 
excellent short film 1 
either way it sucks 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
brilliant 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
brilliant 1 
not my thing 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this place is great 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
how awesome is that 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
very displeased 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great charger 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
love it great armband 1 
dont do it 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
good case 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i love it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great charger 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the battery works great 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
service sucks 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this place is great 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great charger 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i wont be back 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
go and see it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
not my thing 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
last time buying from you 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
fantastic service here 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great phone 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great charger 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great charger 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
not a good bargain 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
not enough volume 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i wont be back 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
great phone 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
not my thing 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
no real improvement 0 
excellent product 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i want my money back 0

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
no real improvement 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
dont do it 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
good servicecheck 1 
great product 1 
will not be back 0 
never going back 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
its a great item 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1
