best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
will order from them again 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
last time buying from you 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
love it great armband 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great movie 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
will be back again 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
omit watching this 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
will be back again 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
crisp and clear 1 
either way it sucks 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
great phone 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
worst phone ever 0 
a bit predictable 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
no real improvement 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great bluetooth 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
better than new 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
works great 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
good case 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
excellent product 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
very displeased 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this place is great 1 
soggy and not good 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i want my money back 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
worthwhile 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
fantastic service here 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
dont do it 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
service sucks 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is great 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this place is great 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great phone 1 
great sound and service 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great charger 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
not my thing 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i want my money back 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
not my thing 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
will not be back 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
cool phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
excellent short film 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great product 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
a bit predictable 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
works great 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i want my money back 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
good transmit audio 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
great phone 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
better than new 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
good case 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0

excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
great movie 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1
