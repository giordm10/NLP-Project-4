poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
great sound and service 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
love it great armband 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
last time buying from you 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
very displeased 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
soggy and not good 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this place has it 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
go watch it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great phone 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
omit watching this 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
good servicecheck 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
will not be back 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i will not return 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i want my money back 0 
that was nice 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
good case 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
will not be back 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0

it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
crisp and clear 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great phone 1

conclusion i loved it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0

not my thing 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
never going back 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
everything is appalling 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
excellent product 1 
will order from them again 1

this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
soggy and not good 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellent product 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
its a great item 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
either way it sucks 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
worthwhile 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
brilliant 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1

if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0

this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great phone 1 
great bluetooth 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
how awesome is that 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
soggy and not good 0 
never going back 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
go and see it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great phone 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
that was nice 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
excellent short film 1 
i wont be back 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1
