the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

the lighting is awful 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1

great bluetooth 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i wont be back 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great phone 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1

clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
dont do it 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
omit watching this 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
great sound and service 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1

i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
its a great item 1 
great product 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great movie 1 
worthwhile 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
service sucks 0

the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i wont be back 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i love it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the battery works great 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
excellent product 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i wont be back 0 
love it great armband 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
better than new 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
its a great item 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
really really good rice all the time 1

a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
a bit predictable 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
worst phone ever 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great charger 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
warning do not buy 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
will be back again 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
good case 1 
i wont be back 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
go and see it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i love it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
not my thing 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
service sucks 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
last time buying from you 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
no real improvement 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
crisp and clear 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
works great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
not a good bargain 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
go watch it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the battery works great 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
will not be back 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
not my thing 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
omit watching this 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
excellent short film 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
crisp and clear 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
dont do it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
excellent short film 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1
