poor quality and service 0

i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
poor quality and service 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
great charger 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1

paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
never going back 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
great charger 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
that one didnt work either 0

im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0

this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
good transmit audio 1

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
either way it sucks 0 
brilliant 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

but then they came back cold 0 
brilliant 1 
great sound and service 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this place has it 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
excellent product 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

omit watching this 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
dont waste your money and time 0

i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
good case 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1

the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this place is great 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0

sprint terrible customer service 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
great movie 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
dont do it 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
great sound and service 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great sound and service 1 
great bluetooth 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
will order from them again 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
never going back 0

i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
its a great item 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
will not be back 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
nice spicy and tender 1

talk about useless customer service 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
will not be back 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
good transmit audio 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
excellent short film 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
great phone 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0

it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0

i am more than happy with this product 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1
