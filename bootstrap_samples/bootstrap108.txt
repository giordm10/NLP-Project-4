a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
very displeased 0 
better than new 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i will not return 0 
i love it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
omit watching this 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
will order from them again 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
go watch it 1 
great product 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great movie 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
either way it sucks 0 
great product 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great movie 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great phone 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
brilliant 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
no real improvement 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
crisp and clear 1 
brilliant 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i wont be back 0 
great sound and service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this place has it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
go and see it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
go and see it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0

the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
that was nice 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
service sucks 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
fantastic service here 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
either way it sucks 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
its a great item 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
brilliant 1 
not a good bargain 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
great phone 1 
brilliant 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this place has it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not enough volume 0 
this place has it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
works great 1 
go and see it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
better than new 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0

the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
excellent short film 1

the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0

basically the service was very bad 0 
last time buying from you 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
never going back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great charger 1

cool phone 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
cool phone 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1
