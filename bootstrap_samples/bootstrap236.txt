i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i will not return 0 
excellent product 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
not my thing 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
will not be back 0 
i want my money back 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this place has it 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
great product 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
not a good bargain 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
worthwhile 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
great product 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
service sucks 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
basically the service was very bad 0

soggy and not good 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i want my money back 0 
good case 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i love it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
good servicecheck 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great sound and service 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
crisp and clear 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
fantastic service here 1 
good servicecheck 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
love it great armband 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0

ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
great sound and service 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i wont be back 0 
cool phone 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
omit watching this 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
very displeased 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
great phone 1 
poor quality and service 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
go watch it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
better than new 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
never going back 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
omit watching this 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
great product 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great phone 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
go and see it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
will order from them again 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
its a great item 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
its a great item 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
go and see it 1 
no real improvement 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
go and see it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the battery works great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great product 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1
