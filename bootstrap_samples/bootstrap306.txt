that one didnt work either 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
cool phone 1 
service sucks 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
great phone 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i want my money back 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great movie 1 
this place is great 1 
better than new 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
never going back 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great movie 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great sound and service 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
better than new 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
service sucks 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
great charger 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
not my thing 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not enough volume 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
worst phone ever 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great phone 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
will be back again 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
everything is appalling 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
poor quality and service 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i wont be back 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
good transmit audio 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
will not be back 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i love it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
cool phone 1 
omit watching this 0 
no real improvement 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i want my money back 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
will not be back 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
warning do not buy 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
worthwhile 1 
works great 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
warning do not buy 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
that was nice 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
very displeased 0 
i love it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
will not be back 0 
great movie 1 
go watch it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
works great 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
brilliant 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i want my money back 0 
not a good bargain 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this place has it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
go and see it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
great bluetooth 1 
warning do not buy 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
service sucks 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this place is great 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
excellent product 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
very displeased 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
excellent product 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great sound and service 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
will be back again 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
very displeased 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
last time buying from you 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great product 1 
not my thing 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
go watch it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
go and see it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1
