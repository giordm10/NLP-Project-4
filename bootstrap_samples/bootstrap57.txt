i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
either way it sucks 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
either way it sucks 0 
service sucks 0 
good case 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
excellent short film 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
everything is appalling 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great movie 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
cool phone 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i want my money back 0 
the battery works great 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great charger 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
worst phone ever 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
dont do it 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
go watch it 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
very displeased 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
great charger 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
excellent short film 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i wont be back 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
will order from them again 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
good case 1 
go and see it 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great movie 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
not enough volume 0 
excellent short film 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i want my money back 0 
its a great item 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
either way it sucks 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
go and see it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
service sucks 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
no real improvement 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the battery works great 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great sound and service 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
warning do not buy 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i want my money back 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
no real improvement 0 
this place is great 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

worst phone ever 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
worthwhile 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
everything is appalling 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
its a great item 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i wont be back 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
love it great armband 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
soggy and not good 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
excellent product 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
its a great item 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
poor quality and service 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1

best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1
