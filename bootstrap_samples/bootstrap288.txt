generous portions and great taste 1 
will not be back 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
good case 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
no real improvement 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
good case 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
never going back 0 
omit watching this 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
excellent short film 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i wont be back 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great product 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
service sucks 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i wont be back 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
good case 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this place is great 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
crisp and clear 1 
worst phone ever 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
go watch it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not my thing 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
works great 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
omit watching this 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
service sucks 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
brilliant 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
worst phone ever 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
better than new 1 
that was nice 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
go and see it 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i want my money back 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
not my thing 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
that was nice 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
good servicecheck 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
brilliant 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
everything is appalling 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
either way it sucks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
everything is appalling 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
great movie 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
omit watching this 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this place has it 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i wont be back 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
will order from them again 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
great product 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
will not be back 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
good transmit audio 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
worst phone ever 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
that was nice 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
works great 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1
