the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
will not be back 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1

i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
go watch it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
very displeased 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent product 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
crisp and clear 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
not enough volume 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
very displeased 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
go and see it 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
great phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
very displeased 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
works great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
cool phone 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
good case 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
great bluetooth 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
not a good bargain 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
great charger 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

i gave it a 10 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
great charger 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
brilliant 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
crisp and clear 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
that was nice 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
that was nice 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this place has it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
never going back 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i will not return 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
that was nice 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
will not be back 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great phone 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
that was nice 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
not a good bargain 0

vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1

i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
dont do it 0 
a bit predictable 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
how awesome is that 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
soggy and not good 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
better than new 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
fantastic service here 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1

it didnt charge for me 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1

overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
love it great armband 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great sound and service 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0
