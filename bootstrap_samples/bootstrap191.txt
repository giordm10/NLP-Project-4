basically the service was very bad 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0

i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
no real improvement 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
works great 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
will be back again 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
poor quality and service 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
no real improvement 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
worthwhile 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great movie 1 
the battery works great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great phone 1 
everything is appalling 0 
its a great item 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service sucks 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i want my money back 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
excellent product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
good servicecheck 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
never going back 0 
cool phone 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
never going back 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
go watch it 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
good case 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellent product for the price 1

we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
not my thing 0 
go and see it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
love it great armband 1 
no real improvement 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1

service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

warning do not buy 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
great product 1

the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
excellent product 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
will be back again 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
dont do it 0 
i definitly recommend 1

all three broke within two months of use 0
