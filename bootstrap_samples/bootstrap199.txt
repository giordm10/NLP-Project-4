i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
crisp and clear 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
a bit predictable 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
omit watching this 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wont be back 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
never going back 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
not a good bargain 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
brilliant 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
will be back again 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great phone 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
works great 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great movie 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
very displeased 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
love it great armband 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
great phone 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
great charger 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
never going back 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
very displeased 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i will not return 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
not enough volume 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
not my thing 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this place is great 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
omit watching this 0 
everything is appalling 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
no real improvement 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
love it great armband 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
crisp and clear 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
not a good bargain 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
dont do it 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
everything is appalling 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the battery works great 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
omit watching this 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
excellent product 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great bluetooth 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this place is great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this place has it 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
dont do it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
worthwhile 1 
brilliant 1 
go watch it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
poor quality and service 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
not a good bargain 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
soggy and not good 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
good servicecheck 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
fantastic service here 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great movie 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
never going back 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
service sucks 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great pizza and salads 1

if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
never going back 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this place has it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i love it 1 
will be back again 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
everything is appalling 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0
