generous portions and great taste 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
its a great item 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great product 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i want my money back 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
great phone 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
great phone 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
works great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
will be back again 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i love it 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i love it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great charger 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great charger 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
omit watching this 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
go watch it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
great charger 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
great sound and service 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
worst phone ever 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great phone 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great product 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
not a good bargain 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
works great 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great phone 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
excellent short film 1 
this place is great 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
go watch it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1
