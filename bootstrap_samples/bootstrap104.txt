not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
cool phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
not enough volume 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i wont be back 0 
i love it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
soggy and not good 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
never going back 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its a great item 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not my thing 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
worthwhile 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
good transmit audio 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
no real improvement 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
warning do not buy 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great product 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
good case 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great phone 1 
excellent short film 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
go and see it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this place has it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i will not return 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great product 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great sound and service 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
that was nice 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
never going back 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
better than new 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
omit watching this 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
cool phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
never going back 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
good case 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
poor quality and service 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
will order from them again 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
will not be back 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
good case 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i will not return 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not my thing 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
excellent product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
not a good bargain 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
great product 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
will be back again 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
will not be back 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
that was nice 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the battery works great 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
omit watching this 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not my thing 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
excellent product 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great phone 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
that was nice 1 
go and see it 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
not my thing 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this place has it 1
