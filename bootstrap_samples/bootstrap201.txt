and none of the tones is acceptable 0

the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0

this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
good case 1 
i wont be back 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0

my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1

the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
works great 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
excellent product 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the battery works great 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
works great 1

the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
no real improvement 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0

i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great phone 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

last time buying from you 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0

i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
service sucks 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
great movie 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
go watch it 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i will not return 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
service sucks 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
works great 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not my thing 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
good transmit audio 1 
great sound and service 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0

it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
worst phone ever 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
brilliant 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
good servicecheck 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
will not be back 0 
very displeased 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
very displeased 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
fantastic service here 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
go and see it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
will order from them again 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
good transmit audio 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
warning do not buy 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i want my money back 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
nice spicy and tender 1

stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
its a great item 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
very displeased 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

the lighting is awful 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0

worthwhile 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0
