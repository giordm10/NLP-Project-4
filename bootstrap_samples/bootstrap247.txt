not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
excellent product 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
works great 1 
cool phone 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
excellent short film 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
better than new 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
great sound and service 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
omit watching this 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
no real improvement 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
very displeased 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i want my money back 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
worthwhile 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
go and see it 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
poor quality and service 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
that was nice 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
better than new 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
omit watching this 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
good transmit audio 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
brilliant 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
love it great armband 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great sound and service 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
will not be back 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this place has it 1 
last time buying from you 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the battery works great 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
go watch it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
brilliant 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i love it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
works great 1 
poor quality and service 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this place is great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
worthwhile 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this place has it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this place is great 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
good case 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
everything is appalling 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
go watch it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i love it 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
a bit predictable 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
good case 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
brilliant 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
great phone 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this place is great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1

it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
worst phone ever 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
works great 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
great sound and service 1 
last time buying from you 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
dont waste your money and time 0
