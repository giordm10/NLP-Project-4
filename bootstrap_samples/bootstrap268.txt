a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
excellent product 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
service sucks 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
dont do it 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
brilliant 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great phone 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
better than new 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
good case 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i wont be back 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
great phone 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
soggy and not good 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wont be back 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i want my money back 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
not enough volume 0 
excellent short film 1

its a great item 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
will not be back 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
not enough volume 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
service sucks 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
good case 1 
everything is appalling 0 
very displeased 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
worst phone ever 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this place is great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
worst phone ever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i wont be back 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1

better than new 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
very displeased 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
cool phone 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its a great item 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
omit watching this 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

i had to purchase a different case 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
great charger 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
not a good bargain 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
soggy and not good 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0

the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0

i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0
