great phone 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
brilliant 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
great movie 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great sound and service 1 
the battery works great 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
everything is appalling 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
great phone 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this place has it 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
not my thing 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
either way it sucks 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
excellent product 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
good transmit audio 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the battery works great 1 
not enough volume 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
everything is appalling 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
works great 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
better than new 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
works great 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
will not be back 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the battery works great 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i wont be back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
last time buying from you 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
poor quality and service 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0

the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
works great 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
not my thing 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
not a good bargain 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
not my thing 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this place is great 1 
great phone 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
omit watching this 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great bluetooth 1 
crisp and clear 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
we loved the biscuits 1

tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
will order from them again 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
its a great item 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
soggy and not good 0 
go watch it 1 
a bit predictable 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
will be back again 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
works great 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
this place has it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great product 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0
