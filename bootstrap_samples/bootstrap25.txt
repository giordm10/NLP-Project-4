the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
good servicecheck 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
that was nice 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
excellent product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i wont be back 0 
cool phone 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
good case 1 
no real improvement 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0

ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
good case 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
worst phone ever 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great phone 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0

if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
how awesome is that 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
not a good bargain 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i wont be back 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great charger 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this place has it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i wont be back 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0

awkward to use and unreliable 0 
very displeased 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
not enough volume 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
last time buying from you 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i was hoping for more 0

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
go and see it 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
omit watching this 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
not my thing 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
will be back again 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i love it 1

its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
last time buying from you 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
better than new 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
brilliant 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
excellent product 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
will not be back 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
will be back again 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1
