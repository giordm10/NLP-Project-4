the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
good transmit audio 1 
excellent short film 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i will not return 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0

conclusion i loved it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great phone 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0

i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
its a great item 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1

not a good bargain 0 
great phone 1

that one didnt work either 0 
i love it 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
never going back 0

i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
those burgers were amazing 1

it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
really really good rice all the time 1

this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
that was nice 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
great phone 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not enough volume 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i love it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
worst phone ever 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its a great item 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
good transmit audio 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
great movie 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
poor quality and service 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
cool phone 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1

the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
fantastic service here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i want my money back 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
go watch it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
will order from them again 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
dont do it 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i wont be back 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i want my money back 0 
i love it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
cool phone 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
excellent product 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
good case 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great product 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
everything is appalling 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
never going back 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
dont do it 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
crisp and clear 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
how awesome is that 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
service sucks 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
will order from them again 1 
works great 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i will not return 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
no real improvement 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0
