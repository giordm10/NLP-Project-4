but this movie really got to me 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0

i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1

it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
no real improvement 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1
