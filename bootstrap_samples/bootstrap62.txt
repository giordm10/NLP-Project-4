this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
brilliant 1 
dont do it 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
a bit predictable 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
great movie 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
excellent product 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
everything is appalling 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
will be back again 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
worthwhile 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
that was nice 1 
worthwhile 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
brilliant 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
not my thing 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great product 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not enough volume 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
never going back 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
excellent product 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i will not return 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
very displeased 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
excellent short film 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
cool phone 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not my thing 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
worst phone ever 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a bit predictable 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1

all three broke within two months of use 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

the dialogue is atrocious 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1

a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
love it great armband 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its a great item 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
not a good bargain 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
last time buying from you 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

that was nice 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
better than new 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this place has it 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
excellent short film 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
cool phone 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0
