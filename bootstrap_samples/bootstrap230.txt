the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
excellent product 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
that was nice 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0

stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great charger 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
never going back 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
very displeased 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
excellent short film 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

and it was way to expensive 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
works great 1 
everything is appalling 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i love it 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
good transmit audio 1 
brilliant 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
great product 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not a good bargain 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
love it great armband 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not my thing 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
soggy and not good 0 
not a good bargain 0 
crisp and clear 1 
great sound and service 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great movie 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the battery works great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
great phone 1 
will order from them again 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the battery works great 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
excellent product 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
good case 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
great sound and service 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
dont do it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
dont do it 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i love it 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
great movie 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
everything is appalling 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
either way it sucks 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
a bit predictable 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
very displeased 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0

the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
good case 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
better than new 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
excellent product 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
crisp and clear 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
very displeased 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great product 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
that was nice 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
dont do it 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
go and see it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0

i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0
