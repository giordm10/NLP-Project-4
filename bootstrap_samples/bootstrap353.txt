we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
its a great item 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this place has it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i wont be back 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1

the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
its a great item 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great phone 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0

but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
i will not return 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
really really good rice all the time 1

service was slow and not attentive 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
go watch it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
soggy and not good 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
cool phone 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
will be back again 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
will be back again 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
good case 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
will order from them again 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
warning do not buy 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
everything is appalling 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1

the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
dont do it 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
cool phone 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
great phone 1 
great charger 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
service sucks 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
go and see it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
will be back again 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great product 1 
a bit predictable 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
no real improvement 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
dont do it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
fantastic service here 1 
cool phone 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
not enough volume 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this place has it 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
better than new 1 
good servicecheck 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
works great 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0

if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
cool phone 1

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0
