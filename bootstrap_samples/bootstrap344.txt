dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
better than new 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
works great 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
works great 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
this place has it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
cool phone 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
crisp and clear 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
no real improvement 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
brilliant 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
service sucks 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
dont do it 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
will order from them again 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
worst phone ever 0 
service sucks 0 
great movie 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
go and see it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
worthwhile 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i want my money back 0 
never going back 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
no real improvement 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
great bluetooth 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great charger 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i want my money back 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
warning do not buy 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
a bit predictable 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
brilliant 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this place is great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
worthwhile 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worthwhile 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i love it 1 
not a good bargain 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
poor quality and service 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
no real improvement 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
very displeased 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great product 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
a bit predictable 0 
great phone 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
will not be back 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
great bluetooth 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
go and see it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
warning do not buy 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
soggy and not good 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great phone 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent product 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this place has it 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great sound and service 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
omit watching this 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
this place has it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
dont do it 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0
