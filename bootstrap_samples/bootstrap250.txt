after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great phone 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
how awesome is that 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
how awesome is that 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good servicecheck 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
will order from them again 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
good transmit audio 1 
great bluetooth 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
never going back 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
good transmit audio 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
a bit predictable 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
go and see it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
great phone 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this place has it 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
worthwhile 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i wont be back 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
excellent short film 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i love it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
will order from them again 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
everything is appalling 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i will not return 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
cool phone 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i love it 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
great product 1 
great product 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this place has it 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
last time buying from you 0

they know how to make them here 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
its a great item 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
works great 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1

ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
a bit predictable 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1

much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
love it great armband 1 
dont do it 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this place is great 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

the directing is sloppy at best 0 
a bit predictable 0

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1

this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
worst phone ever 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

talk about useless customer service 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1

great phone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
not enough volume 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
good servicecheck 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0
