i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i wont be back 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the battery works great 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
good transmit audio 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
that was nice 1 
excellent product 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
excellent product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i want my money back 0 
love it great armband 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
cool phone 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
soggy and not good 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
great phone 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this place is great 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
great sound and service 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
omit watching this 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
warning do not buy 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
works great 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
will be back again 1 
never going back 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i want my money back 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
great sound and service 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i will not return 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
worthwhile 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
not enough volume 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
soggy and not good 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i will not return 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
excellent product 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
good case 1 
good case 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
dont do it 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
works great 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
soggy and not good 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i want my money back 0 
great phone 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
omit watching this 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
worthwhile 1 
not a good bargain 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this place is great 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
excellent product 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
not enough volume 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great phone 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its a great item 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
not my thing 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
poor quality and service 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great phone 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
great bluetooth 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
crisp and clear 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great sound and service 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0
