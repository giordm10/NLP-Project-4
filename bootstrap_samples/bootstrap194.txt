excellent short film 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
everything is appalling 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great movie 1 
warning do not buy 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
not a good bargain 0 
this place is great 1 
last time buying from you 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
good case 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
no real improvement 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
love it great armband 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
last time buying from you 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
love it great armband 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
i want my money back 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
omit watching this 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
love it great armband 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great sound and service 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
will be back again 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
crisp and clear 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
excellent product 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this place is great 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
love it great armband 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
not enough volume 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
last time buying from you 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
go and see it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
its a great item 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the battery works great 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
not my thing 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the battery works great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
that was nice 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not a good bargain 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
good case 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its a great item 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
great phone 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i will not return 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
worthwhile 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i great reception all the time 1

i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
poor quality and service 0 
its a great item 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
go and see it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
love it great armband 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
great phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1

dont waste your money and time 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0

she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
no real improvement 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
crisp and clear 1 
go and see it 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great bluetooth 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great phone 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
omit watching this 0

works great 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0

dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
really really good rice all the time 1
