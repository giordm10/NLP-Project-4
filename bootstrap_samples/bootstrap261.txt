awkward to use and unreliable 0

authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1

but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great product 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
no real improvement 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

great product 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0

this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great sound and service 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
go and see it 1 
good transmit audio 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0

however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1
