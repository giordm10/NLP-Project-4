service sucks 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
its a great item 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its a great item 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
not a good bargain 0 
dont do it 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
excellent short film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
cool phone 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i want my money back 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
brilliant 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
its a great item 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
excellent product 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
omit watching this 0

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0

avoid at all cost 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
works great 1 
omit watching this 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
works great 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
good transmit audio 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
great phone 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
last time buying from you 0 
great phone 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

conclusion i loved it 1 
never going back 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1

and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0

love the margaritas too 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
brilliant 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
worst phone ever 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0

please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the lighting is awful 0

looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
love the margaritas too 1

technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1
