there are some generally great things in it 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
excellent product 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
great product 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
worst phone ever 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
not my thing 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
a bit predictable 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
that was nice 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
will be back again 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
soggy and not good 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
great phone 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
dont do it 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
brilliant 1

the lighting is awful 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
fantastic service here 1 
will not be back 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great phone 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
service sucks 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
good case 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
go watch it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

dont waste your money and time 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
worthwhile 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
great phone 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great charger 1

the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
worst phone ever 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1

good servicecheck 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0

the kids are very cool too 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a bit predictable 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
a bit predictable 0 
go and see it 1

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
love it great armband 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0

no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
poor quality and service 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
go and see it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0
