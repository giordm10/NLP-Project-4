a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont do it 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this place has it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
works great 1 
never going back 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
works great 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
service sucks 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
go watch it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
brilliant 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
excellent short film 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
will be back again 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
dont do it 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
warning do not buy 0 
cool phone 1 
dont do it 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great charger 1 
dont do it 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
service sucks 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
everything is appalling 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
brilliant 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
omit watching this 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
go watch it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
poor quality and service 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
no real improvement 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0

this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
its a great item 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i will not return 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this place is great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
will order from them again 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the battery works great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0

worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
great phone 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
will order from them again 1 
go watch it 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i will not return 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
crisp and clear 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great movie 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this place has it 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0

the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
this is a stunning movie 1

i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0

ive had better atmosphere 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
better than new 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1

this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
never going back 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a bit predictable 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great sound and service 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
how awesome is that 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
a bit predictable 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0

julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great sound and service 1 
brilliant 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
good case 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
not a good bargain 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great bluetooth 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
works great 1
