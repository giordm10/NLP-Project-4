i am more than happy with this product 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i wont be back 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
love it great armband 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i will not return 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
either way it sucks 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
not a good bargain 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great phone 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the battery works great 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
go watch it 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
everything is appalling 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
poor quality and service 0 
worthwhile 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
will be back again 1 
great sound and service 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
love it great armband 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
not my thing 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1
