hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
love it great armband 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
dont do it 0 
dont do it 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its a great item 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
no real improvement 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
that was nice 1 
worthwhile 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
great sound and service 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
excellent short film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
excellent short film 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
last time buying from you 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
love it great armband 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
omit watching this 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
great sound and service 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
go and see it 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this place has it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
love it great armband 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
will be back again 1 
worthwhile 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
great sound and service 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
that was nice 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
great movie 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
no real improvement 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
excellent short film 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
poor quality and service 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
will order from them again 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this place has it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1

overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great phone 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
great phone 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
wont ever go here again 0

excellent product 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this place has it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1

the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
will order from them again 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1

and then tragedy struck 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0

worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
great charger 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
everything is appalling 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
works great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
brilliant 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
fantastic service here 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
warning do not buy 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0

it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1
