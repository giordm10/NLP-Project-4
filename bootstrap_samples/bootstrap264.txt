vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
cool phone 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
works great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i want my money back 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i wont be back 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i wont be back 0 
omit watching this 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
not my thing 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
never going back 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
great phone 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
better than new 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
no real improvement 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
brilliant 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
omit watching this 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
great phone 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
great sound and service 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
will not be back 0 
not a good bargain 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i wont be back 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1

battery is holding up well 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i wont be back 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its a great item 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
will not be back 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1

this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
warning do not buy 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
not enough volume 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0

battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
omit watching this 0 
crisp and clear 1

this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
never going back 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
dont do it 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
that was nice 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0

excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i will not return 0 
a bit predictable 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i want my money back 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0

excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
excellent short film 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
this place is great 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1

he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
good transmit audio 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
that was nice 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1
