the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great phone 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great charger 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great charger 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
good transmit audio 1 
will not be back 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
great phone 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
brilliant 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
a bit predictable 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
good servicecheck 1 
good servicecheck 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
works great 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i want my money back 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
fantastic service here 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great phone 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
omit watching this 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
cool phone 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great charger 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i will not return 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
good transmit audio 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
great phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
no real improvement 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
crisp and clear 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
its a great item 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i wont be back 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this place is great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
will order from them again 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
good servicecheck 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
not enough volume 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
not enough volume 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
great phone 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
good case 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
go and see it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
dont do it 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great product 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great sound and service 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great charger 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wont be back 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1

an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0
