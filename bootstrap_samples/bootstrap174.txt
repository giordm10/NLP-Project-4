i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
brilliant 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
excellent product 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
not my thing 0 
good case 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
not enough volume 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
worthwhile 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
brilliant 1 
works great 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
will be back again 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
never going back 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
either way it sucks 0 
omit watching this 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
will be back again 1 
good case 1 
great charger 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
omit watching this 0 
great movie 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
not enough volume 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
that was nice 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
no real improvement 0 
great charger 1 
great product 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
good case 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
good transmit audio 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
that was nice 1 
either way it sucks 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
last time buying from you 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
better than new 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
worst phone ever 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
not my thing 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
not enough volume 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
not a good bargain 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
will be back again 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
great charger 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
will order from them again 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
last time buying from you 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
good servicecheck 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
soggy and not good 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
fantastic service here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
fantastic service here 1 
great charger 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
will order from them again 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
poor quality and service 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
very displeased 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i will not return 0 
good transmit audio 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1

the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0

the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i wont be back 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
service sucks 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1

what a big waste of time 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
soggy and not good 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0

and then tragedy struck 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1

that was nice 1

its a great item 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
great charger 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0
