the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great phone 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
cool phone 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
last time buying from you 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
works great 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
that was nice 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
how awesome is that 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
love it great armband 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i wont be back 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
good case 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
that was nice 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the battery works great 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
excellent short film 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
worthwhile 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good case 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great phone 1 
warning do not buy 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
its a great item 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
works great 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
no real improvement 0 
i love it 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
worthwhile 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the battery works great 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
will not be back 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
brilliant 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
cool phone 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
go and see it 1 
poor quality and service 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
dont do it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
will not be back 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
soggy and not good 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i want my money back 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
good case 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
great phone 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great product 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
warning do not buy 0 
that was nice 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0

fantastic service here 1 
not my thing 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
either way it sucks 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
never going back 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great product 1 
good case 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0

i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
that one didnt work either 0

very displeased 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1

stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great sound and service 1
