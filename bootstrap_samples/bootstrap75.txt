the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this place is great 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
not enough volume 0 
love it great armband 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
will not be back 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
not a good bargain 0 
good servicecheck 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
will order from them again 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great movie 1 
everything is appalling 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this place has it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
warning do not buy 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
not my thing 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
great bluetooth 1 
brilliant 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
not enough volume 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not enough volume 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
excellent product 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great charger 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
better than new 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
that was nice 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good case 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
love it great armband 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
not enough volume 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
that was nice 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
will order from them again 1 
will order from them again 1

thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
never going back 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great bluetooth 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this place is great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great sound and service 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
great movie 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
crisp and clear 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
no real improvement 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
poor quality and service 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
a bit predictable 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
brilliant 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
will not be back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
good transmit audio 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
good case 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
will order from them again 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1
