nice spicy and tender 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great movie 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
good transmit audio 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i want my money back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
omit watching this 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not a good bargain 0 
great phone 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
good case 1 
will be back again 1 
love it great armband 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
a bit predictable 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i love it 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
excellent product 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
poor quality and service 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
great product 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
not a good bargain 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
not a good bargain 0 
a bit predictable 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
warning do not buy 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
service sucks 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1

the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
good case 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i want my money back 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
excellent short film 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
will not be back 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
omit watching this 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
dont do it 0 
great product 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
never going back 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
how awesome is that 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
service sucks 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
omit watching this 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
very displeased 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great bluetooth 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
service sucks 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great sound and service 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
very displeased 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
how awesome is that 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
how awesome is that 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
either way it sucks 0 
will order from them again 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
will be back again 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
brilliant 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
excellent short film 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
fantastic service here 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
how awesome is that 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
not my thing 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
great bluetooth 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
love it great armband 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
not enough volume 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
worthwhile 1 
soggy and not good 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
great phone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0
