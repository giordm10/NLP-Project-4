when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i want my money back 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
go and see it 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
go watch it 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
never going back 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
will be back again 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
worthwhile 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
soggy and not good 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great product 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
will order from them again 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i wont be back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
great bluetooth 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
never going back 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
worst phone ever 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
great sound and service 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
not my thing 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i will not return 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
its a great item 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
service sucks 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
service sucks 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this place is great 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
will not be back 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
great phone 1 
fantastic service here 1 
brilliant 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great charger 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
excellent product 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
worthwhile 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i love it 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
not enough volume 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
good case 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not my thing 0 
go and see it 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
cool phone 1 
that was nice 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i will not return 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
will be back again 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not enough volume 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
everything is appalling 0 
not my thing 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
dont do it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
either way it sucks 0 
love it great armband 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
everything is appalling 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
good case 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great phone 1 
will not be back 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
soggy and not good 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
will be back again 1 
great movie 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
how awesome is that 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
worst phone ever 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i wont be back 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0
