the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
fantastic service here 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
will order from them again 1 
great sound and service 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
great bluetooth 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i will not return 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the battery works great 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
service sucks 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
no real improvement 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
great phone 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great sound and service 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
good case 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
go watch it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
not enough volume 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
omit watching this 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i want my money back 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
great phone 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1

poor quality and service 0

our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
works great 1

but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i love it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0

that was nice 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1

overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
what a big waste of time 0

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the battery works great 1

today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1

its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
no real improvement 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0
