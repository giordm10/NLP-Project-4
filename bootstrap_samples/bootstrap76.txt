it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
good transmit audio 1

the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great movie 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
good case 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
go watch it 1 
cool phone 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
good case 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
a bit predictable 0 
great phone 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0

vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worthwhile 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
brilliant 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
soggy and not good 0 
not a good bargain 0 
soggy and not good 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
love it great armband 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
no real improvement 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
not enough volume 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this place is great 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
its a great item 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
great movie 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0

the case is great and works fine with the 680 1

i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
works great 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1

an excellent performance from ms 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0

the replacement died in a few weeks 0

never had anything to complain about here 1 
good servicecheck 1

sauce was tasteless 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
this place is great 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0

it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

better than new 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1

no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great sound and service 1 
not my thing 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0

dont waste your money and time 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
how awesome is that 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
will not be back 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
great phone 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
either way it sucks 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1

those burgers were amazing 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
no real improvement 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the battery works great 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
great movie 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0
