i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
worthwhile 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i want my money back 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
great phone 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
works great 1 
the battery works great 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
never going back 0 
worthwhile 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
dont do it 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
everything is appalling 0 
great charger 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
soggy and not good 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
go watch it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont do it 0 
everything is appalling 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this place has it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
great sound and service 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
no real improvement 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
will not be back 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not enough volume 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
great phone 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
will be back again 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
good transmit audio 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
love it great armband 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i will not return 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i wont be back 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
not my thing 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
not a good bargain 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
not my thing 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the battery works great 1 
its a great item 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great sound and service 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1

as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
great charger 1 
love it great armband 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i want my money back 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
everything is appalling 0 
cool phone 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
how awesome is that 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
last time buying from you 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
that was nice 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great movie 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this place is great 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
brilliant 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
great product 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
not my thing 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
very displeased 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
what a big waste of time 0

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
worthwhile 1 
a bit predictable 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
dont do it 0 
great phone 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i love it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
brilliant 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
great sound and service 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

but this movie really got to me 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
go watch it 1 
go and see it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
excellent short film 1 
go watch it 1
