i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
better than new 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great phone 1 
that was nice 1 
i love it 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i wont be back 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great product 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this place has it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
omit watching this 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
go watch it 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
great sound and service 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
how awesome is that 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
great bluetooth 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
not my thing 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
no real improvement 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
great product 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
not enough volume 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
works great 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the battery works great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
crisp and clear 1 
how awesome is that 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
last time buying from you 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
cool phone 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
brilliant 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
dont do it 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i wont be back 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this place is great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
worst phone ever 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
go and see it 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
that was nice 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
great movie 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
good transmit audio 1 
dont do it 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
works great 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
poor quality and service 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
great charger 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
brilliant 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
excellent product 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this place has it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great product 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i love it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
everything is appalling 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
no real improvement 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
great movie 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i love it 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i love it 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0
