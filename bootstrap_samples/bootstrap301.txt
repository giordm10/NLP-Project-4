great bluetooth 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i will not return 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
go and see it 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
will order from them again 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the battery works great 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i love it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
excellent short film 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
worst phone ever 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
excellent short film 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
works great 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
last time buying from you 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
will not be back 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great movie 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
good case 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great sound and service 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
cool phone 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
great sound and service 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

soggy and not good 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
last time buying from you 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
worst phone ever 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
that was nice 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
how awesome is that 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
worthwhile 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
great bluetooth 1 
great movie 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
very displeased 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
better than new 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
warning do not buy 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
never going back 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1

the directing is sloppy at best 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
cool phone 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
either way it sucks 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
works great 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
works great 1 
fantastic service here 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
love it great armband 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i want my money back 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great movie 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great sound and service 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not enough volume 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i want my money back 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
love it great armband 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1
