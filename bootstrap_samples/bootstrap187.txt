it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this place has it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
go watch it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
no real improvement 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
its a great item 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
will order from them again 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good case 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great movie 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i wont be back 0 
its a great item 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
great sound and service 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
will not be back 0 
love it great armband 1 
good transmit audio 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
not my thing 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great movie 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
never going back 0 
crisp and clear 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
either way it sucks 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
worst phone ever 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
everything is appalling 0 
very displeased 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i want my money back 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the battery works great 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
either way it sucks 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great phone 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
great product 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great bluetooth 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
great bluetooth 1 
omit watching this 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
how awesome is that 1 
good servicecheck 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
a bit predictable 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
not enough volume 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
its a great item 1 
go watch it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
go and see it 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
last time buying from you 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
its a great item 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
either way it sucks 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
good servicecheck 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
good case 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
great charger 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
everything is appalling 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
great sound and service 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great product 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1

the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
worthwhile 1 
this place has it 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the battery works great 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
love it great armband 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
cool phone 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
great bluetooth 1

i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
go watch it 1 
cool phone 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1

sprint terrible customer service 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0
