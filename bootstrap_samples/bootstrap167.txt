its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i wont be back 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i will not return 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
not enough volume 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
either way it sucks 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
great bluetooth 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
omit watching this 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
crisp and clear 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
go and see it 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
warning do not buy 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this place is great 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i wont be back 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i love it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
worst phone ever 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
excellent product 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
no real improvement 0 
dont do it 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
that was nice 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
that was nice 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
brilliant 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
love it great armband 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
warning do not buy 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i want my money back 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
good case 1 
great sound and service 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
dont do it 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
never going back 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
soggy and not good 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i love it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
good transmit audio 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i love it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
will not be back 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
good servicecheck 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
omit watching this 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
will order from them again 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
brilliant 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1

if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
brilliant 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
cool phone 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
not enough volume 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0

if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0

great phone 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0

i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
excellent product 1 
not my thing 0 
crisp and clear 1 
a bit predictable 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
go and see it 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
its a great item 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
very displeased 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0

always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1

i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
love it great armband 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great charger 1 
its a great item 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1

the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
great pizza and salads 1

i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
warning do not buy 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0
