the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
worthwhile 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
service sucks 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0

and then tragedy struck 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0

there are some generally great things in it 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
never going back 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i will not return 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
how awesome is that 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1

but this movie really got to me 1 
go watch it 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0

tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
that was nice 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1

do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this place has it 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i wont be back 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great bluetooth 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0

dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
not my thing 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
talk about useless customer service 0

it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
works great 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i could not recommend these more 0

this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
good transmit audio 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
excellent short film 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
not enough volume 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0

provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
will order from them again 1 
brilliant 1

bacon is hella salty 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
that was nice 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
bacon is hella salty 1

sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its a great item 1 
great charger 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0

i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1

this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0

the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
excellent product 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
excellent short film 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
omit watching this 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
either way it sucks 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0

a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
excellent product 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0

they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
brilliant 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
good servicecheck 1
