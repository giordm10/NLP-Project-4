it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
will not be back 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
better than new 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
everything is appalling 0 
will be back again 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
a bit predictable 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
poor quality and service 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent short film 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great phone 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i will not return 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this place is great 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
will be back again 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
good case 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
great phone 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this place is great 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this place has it 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
will order from them again 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
its a great item 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
how awesome is that 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
will not be back 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
that was nice 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
crisp and clear 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
better than new 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
great charger 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
good servicecheck 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
very displeased 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
cool phone 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
will order from them again 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1

i came out of it feeling angry 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i wont be back 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i want my money back 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
brilliant 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
it didnt charge for me 0

just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
will order from them again 1 
fantastic service here 1 
either way it sucks 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1

overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
will be back again 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
soggy and not good 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
great bluetooth 1

i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its a great item 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1
