even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
not enough volume 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
worst phone ever 0 
go watch it 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
warning do not buy 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
brilliant 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i love it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
that was nice 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
very displeased 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
will not be back 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
good case 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
better than new 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
no real improvement 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
cool phone 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
good servicecheck 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
cool phone 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
excellent short film 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
no real improvement 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
works great 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
worthwhile 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont do it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvÃ¥g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
will not be back 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
worthwhile 1 
i will not return 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
worthwhile 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
soggy and not good 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
good transmit audio 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
excellent product 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
go and see it 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
not enough volume 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
great bluetooth 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i really enjoyed crema cafÃ© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this place is great 1

but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
will not be back 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
better than new 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
great phone 1

i wont be back 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1

we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0
