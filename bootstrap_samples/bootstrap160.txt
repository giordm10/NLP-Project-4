the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
excellent product 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
this place has it 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
not a good bargain 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i wont be back 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
last time buying from you 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
cool phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
not my thing 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
brilliant 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
that was nice 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
great movie 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great product 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
will order from them again 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
good case 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
very displeased 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
worst phone ever 0 
soggy and not good 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
last time buying from you 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
brilliant 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
no real improvement 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
works great 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
how awesome is that 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
omit watching this 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
worthwhile 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
service sucks 0 
not my thing 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
a bit predictable 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this place is great 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
that was nice 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

the battery works great 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
its a great item 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
but then they came back cold 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
works great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the battery works great 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
worst phone ever 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great charger 1 
worthwhile 1 
great movie 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i will not return 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not my thing 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this place has it 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
better than new 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1
