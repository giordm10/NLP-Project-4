stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
omit watching this 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
service sucks 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i will not return 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
crisp and clear 1 
never going back 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great bluetooth 1 
excellent short film 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
everything is appalling 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
dont do it 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
everything is appalling 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
better than new 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i love it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
crisp and clear 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
omit watching this 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
omit watching this 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the battery works great 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
go watch it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
great phone 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the battery works great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
go and see it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
warning do not buy 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i will not return 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
not my thing 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great product 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
works great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great movie 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
its a great item 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
omit watching this 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
great charger 1 
not enough volume 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this place has it 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

i was hoping for more 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0

my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1

great phone 1 
great phone 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0

and none of the tones is acceptable 0

excellent product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0

we loved the biscuits 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0
