the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
omit watching this 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
never going back 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this place is great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
that was nice 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
go watch it 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
soggy and not good 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
brilliant 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
crisp and clear 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
worst phone ever 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
service sucks 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
not enough volume 0 
excellent short film 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
very displeased 0 
not my thing 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
fantastic service here 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
a bit predictable 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i want my money back 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
excellent short film 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
will order from them again 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
cool phone 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
how awesome is that 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
dont do it 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
either way it sucks 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
brilliant 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
works great 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
great bluetooth 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
omit watching this 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i love it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
works great 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
worst phone ever 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great bluetooth 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
excellent product 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
will not be back 0 
great bluetooth 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
excellent short film 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
great phone 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this place has it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1
