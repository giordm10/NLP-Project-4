the rest of the cast also play well 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0

kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
warning do not buy 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
will not be back 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
not a good bargain 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0

best bluetooth on the market 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1

love it great armband 1 
its a great item 1 
service sucks 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
everything is appalling 0 
dont do it 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0

one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
go and see it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
its a great item 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

poor quality and service 0

she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0

a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0

the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1

my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0

no buyers remorse on this one 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this is a stunning movie 1

i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0
