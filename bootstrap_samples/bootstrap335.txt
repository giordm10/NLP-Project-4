will order from them again 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
works great 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
this place is great 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
crisp and clear 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the battery works great 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
poor quality and service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
worst phone ever 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
poor quality and service 0 
will not be back 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
never going back 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this place has it 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
love it great armband 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
works great 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1

so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0

great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great product 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great movie 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great movie 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1

lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0

great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
how awesome is that 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
omit watching this 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
go and see it 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
never going back 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
not enough volume 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the battery works great 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
last time buying from you 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this place is great 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
not enough volume 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1

after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great product 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
good case 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great movie 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
soggy and not good 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
a bit predictable 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
better than new 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1

great charger 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1

they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1

i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1
