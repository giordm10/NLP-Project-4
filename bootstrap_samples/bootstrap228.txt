jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
go and see it 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great phone 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
excellent short film 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
service sucks 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
great movie 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
warning do not buy 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
this place has it 1 
go and see it 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
no real improvement 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
great phone 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
very displeased 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
love it great armband 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
cool phone 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
brilliant 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
not enough volume 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
a bit predictable 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1

excellent wallet type phone case 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this place is great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
not a good bargain 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1

that was nice 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
love it great armband 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0

unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i wont be back 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
go and see it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
service sucks 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
not enough volume 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i want my money back 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
worst phone ever 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
excellent product 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
excellent short film 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
dont do it 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
not my thing 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
good case 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
warning do not buy 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
never going back 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this place has it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i love it 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the battery works great 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this place has it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
never going back 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
excellent short film 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
worst phone ever 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1
