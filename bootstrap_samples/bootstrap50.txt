real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0

one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
never going back 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0

those burgers were amazing 1 
very displeased 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0

the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1

overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
last time buying from you 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0

excellent product 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
great phone 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
works great 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
everything is appalling 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1

for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the battery works great 1 
this place has it 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
this place is great 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
not a good bargain 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
great phone 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
no real improvement 0 
great product 1

a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0

every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i wont be back 0

basically the service was very bad 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1

the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
omit watching this 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0

excellent short film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0

i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
how awesome is that 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
brilliant 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1

service was slow and not attentive 0

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0

what a big waste of time 0

stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
and then tragedy struck 0
