the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
brilliant 1 
how awesome is that 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
either way it sucks 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
excellent short film 1 
will order from them again 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i wont be back 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
a bit predictable 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the battery works great 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this place is great 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i will not return 0 
no real improvement 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
will not be back 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
a bit predictable 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
i wont be back 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
service sucks 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
worthwhile 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
its a great item 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
cool phone 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
that was nice 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
never going back 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
poor quality and service 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
everything is appalling 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
its a great item 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this place is great 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
great bluetooth 1 
very displeased 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
service sucks 0 
conclusion i loved it 1

the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
fantastic service here 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the battery works great 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i wont be back 0

conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1

this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1

if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1

tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
excellent product 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0

an excellent performance from ms 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1

angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0
