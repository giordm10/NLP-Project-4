i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the battery works great 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
great sound and service 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
love it great armband 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
last time buying from you 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
that was nice 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i love it 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
omit watching this 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0

i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
not my thing 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
go watch it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1

the item received was counterfeit 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
poor quality and service 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
will not be back 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
not enough volume 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
go and see it 1

anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the battery works great 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i love it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
how awesome is that 1 
go and see it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this place is great 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this place is great 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
last time buying from you 0 
warning do not buy 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
works great 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
service sucks 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
dont do it 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
omit watching this 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not a good bargain 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i wont be back 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1

good servicecheck 1 
everything is appalling 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
a bit predictable 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
either way it sucks 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i want my money back 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0

that one didnt work either 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
no real improvement 0

the replacement died in a few weeks 0

ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1

this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
warning do not buy 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1
