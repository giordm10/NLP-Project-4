plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1

director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
last time buying from you 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
very displeased 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
dont do it 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
not a good bargain 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
last time buying from you 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i will not return 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
will not be back 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
brilliant 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
soggy and not good 0 
crisp and clear 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
not a good bargain 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great sound and service 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
not enough volume 0 
its a great item 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great product 1 
a bit predictable 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the kids are very cool too 1

our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
omit watching this 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the battery works great 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
love it great armband 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1

the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
dont do it 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
excellent product 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0

battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0

i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i want my money back 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
that was nice 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
not a good bargain 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1

the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
that was nice 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
good transmit audio 1

generous portions and great taste 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
worst phone ever 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great movie 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
great phone 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
go watch it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i want my money back 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
omit watching this 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1
