excellent wallet type phone case 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
cool phone 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
warning do not buy 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
great movie 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
will not be back 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
a bit predictable 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
love it great armband 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
go watch it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
worst phone ever 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this place has it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
brilliant 1

best bluetooth on the market 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
no real improvement 0 
never going back 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
dont waste your money and time 0

i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
excellent short film 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i wont be back 0 
i love it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
good servicecheck 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
service sucks 0 
i wont be back 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1

definitely a bargain 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
never going back 0 
warning do not buy 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
service sucks 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great charger 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
great sound and service 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0

worthwhile 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
crisp and clear 1

either way it sucks 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
soggy and not good 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1

clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
works great 1

theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
go watch it 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0

great phone 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
how awesome is that 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
not my thing 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1

at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
not enough volume 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0
