great phone 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
go and see it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
its a great item 1 
how awesome is that 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
poor quality and service 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
love it great armband 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
great sound and service 1 
how awesome is that 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
dont do it 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great phone 1 
good case 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
that was nice 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
service sucks 0 
service sucks 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this place is great 1 
this place is great 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
never going back 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
go and see it 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
not enough volume 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
worthwhile 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
excellent product 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
never going back 0 
great product 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this place is great 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
works great 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
cool phone 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
brilliant 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
brilliant 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
omit watching this 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
a bit predictable 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
will be back again 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
works great 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i want my money back 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
great movie 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
never going back 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
great product 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
love it great armband 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great movie 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
excellent short film 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the battery works great 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
last time buying from you 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
brilliant 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
never going back 0 
last time buying from you 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
great bluetooth 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
love it great armband 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
either way it sucks 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
cool phone 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
worthwhile 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
great phone 1

a great way to finish a great 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
worst phone ever 0 
this place is great 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
will be back again 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
great phone 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
a bit predictable 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
crisp and clear 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1
