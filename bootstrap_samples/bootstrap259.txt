it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great phone 1 
omit watching this 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
that was nice 1 
i love it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
that was nice 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
either way it sucks 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
will not be back 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
works great 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
poor quality and service 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
good servicecheck 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
the battery works great 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
i will not return 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
cool phone 1 
this place has it 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont do it 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
great phone 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not a good bargain 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
this place has it 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
great charger 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
excellent product 1 
service sucks 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
good case 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
great movie 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
service sucks 0 
great movie 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
not my thing 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
good case 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great charger 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i will not return 0 
good case 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
poor quality and service 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
i wont be back 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
no real improvement 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
poor quality and service 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
worst phone ever 0 
great movie 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wont be back 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
not a good bargain 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
will be back again 1 
i want my money back 0 
this place is great 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
great product 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great phone 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the battery works great 1 
will be back again 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
its a great item 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1
