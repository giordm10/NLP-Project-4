the item received was counterfeit 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
fantastic service here 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
great sound and service 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
that was nice 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
great phone 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1

his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the battery works great 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1

excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
works great 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0

shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
its a great item 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
that was nice 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
great phone 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
not my thing 0 
great charger 1 
service sucks 0 
service sucks 0 
better than new 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great phone 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
great phone 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
definitely a bargain 1

the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
great movie 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
cool phone 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1

authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
last time buying from you 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
will order from them again 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
cool phone 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
not enough volume 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0

as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
worst phone ever 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
we loved the biscuits 1

my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this place is great 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0

the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
not a good bargain 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
go and see it 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1

vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
excellent short film 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1

this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0
