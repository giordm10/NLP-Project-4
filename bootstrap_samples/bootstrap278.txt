i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i will not return 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
good transmit audio 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
go and see it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
worthwhile 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
the battery works great 1 
never going back 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
that was nice 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
not my thing 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
works great 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great product 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
good transmit audio 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
great phone 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
no real improvement 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
crisp and clear 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the battery works great 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
excellent short film 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
i will not return 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the battery works great 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great charger 1 
great phone 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
dont do it 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
love it great armband 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
service sucks 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
generous portions and great taste 1

really really good rice all the time 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i will not return 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
better than new 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i will not return 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the battery works great 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
excellent product 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
no real improvement 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
very displeased 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
good servicecheck 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
omit watching this 0

the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
great charger 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1

i gave it a 10 1
