it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
good servicecheck 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
this place is great 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i will not return 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
never going back 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
very displeased 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this place is great 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
worst phone ever 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
love it great armband 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
good transmit audio 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
crisp and clear 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
go and see it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this place has it 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
not a good bargain 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
that was nice 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the battery works great 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
crisp and clear 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
very displeased 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
last time buying from you 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i want my money back 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
omit watching this 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
very displeased 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
cool phone 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
good transmit audio 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
brilliant 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
its a great item 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
will order from them again 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
cool phone 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
great phone 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
not a good bargain 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
will order from them again 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
brilliant 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
that was nice 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
not my thing 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
great bluetooth 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
good transmit audio 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0

buy a different phone but not this 0 
very displeased 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
crisp and clear 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i wont be back 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
go watch it 1 
great product 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
good servicecheck 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
i wont be back 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
never going back 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1

linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
either way it sucks 0 
service sucks 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
dont do it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
will order from them again 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
great phone 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i want my money back 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
works great 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
dont do it 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
fantastic service here 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
will not be back 0 
how awesome is that 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1
