i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
will not be back 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
omit watching this 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i will not return 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
not a good bargain 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
never going back 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i love it 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
great bluetooth 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
great sound and service 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
great phone 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
go watch it 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i want my money back 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
cool phone 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
excellent short film 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
dont do it 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
great bluetooth 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
worthwhile 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
go and see it 1 
not my thing 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
no real improvement 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
go and see it 1 
service sucks 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
great phone 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
better than new 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
great bluetooth 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
go and see it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichÃ©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
great movie 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
service sucks 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
this place is great 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
i want my money back 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
great product 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
will be back again 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
very displeased 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0

great charger 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
go watch it 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1

his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
that was nice 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
great movie 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
excellent product 1 
not my thing 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
never going back 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
good servicecheck 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of quÃ©bec 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
will order from them again 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
great charger 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
dont do it 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
great charger 1 
excellent product 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
cool phone 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1
