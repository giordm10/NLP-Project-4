the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
excellent product 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
great charger 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
great movie 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
fantastic service here 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
either way it sucks 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i wont be back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
great sound and service 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
not enough volume 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the battery works great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
warning do not buy 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
will order from them again 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
either way it sucks 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
worst phone ever 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
go watch it 1 
go and see it 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the battery works great 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
great product 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
good transmit audio 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
love it great armband 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
great bluetooth 1 
great product 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
i will not return 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i love it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
not a good bargain 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i will not return 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i want my money back 0 
will be back again 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
no real improvement 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
a bit predictable 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
love it great armband 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
crisp and clear 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
works great 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
will not be back 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
good transmit audio 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
not enough volume 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
great charger 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
go and see it 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
great movie 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
fantastic service here 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
great phone 1 
i want my money back 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1

conclusion i loved it 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
not my thing 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
go watch it 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
excellent short film 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
great phone 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
no real improvement 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not a good bargain 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
its a great item 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0

this is not moviemaking 0

i gave it a 10 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
go and see it 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0
