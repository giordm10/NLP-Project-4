excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
good case 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1

when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
no real improvement 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
dont do it 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0

great bluetooth 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
not a good bargain 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
great phone 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
no real improvement 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
poor quality and service 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
this place has it 1 
excellent short film 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
good transmit audio 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
good case 1 
i will not return 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the battery works great 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the battery works great 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
great product 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
that was nice 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
a bit predictable 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
not my thing 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
this place is great 1 
better than new 1 
good case 1 
very displeased 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
worthwhile 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
that was nice 1 
this place is great 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
good transmit audio 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
omit watching this 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
good transmit audio 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
its a great item 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
fantastic service here 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
great charger 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
go watch it 1 
dont do it 0 
excellent short film 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the battery works great 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
will be back again 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i will not return 0 
service sucks 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
great movie 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
good case 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
good case 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
no real improvement 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
dont do it 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
no real improvement 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
worthwhile 1 
worthwhile 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
warning do not buy 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
dont do it 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0
