excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
great bluetooth 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
good case 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
no real improvement 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
fantastic service here 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
dont do it 0 
great sound and service 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this place is great 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
will order from them again 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
soggy and not good 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
go watch it 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
either way it sucks 0

thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
better than new 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
everything is appalling 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
a bit predictable 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i want my money back 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
never going back 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
dont do it 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
go watch it 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
good servicecheck 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
great phone 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
excellent short film 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0

however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0

just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1

dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0

brilliant 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
this place is great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
service sucks 0 
worst phone ever 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1

will order from them again 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0

the rest of the cast also play well 1 
brilliant 1 
i love it 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
omit watching this 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1

love the margaritas too 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0

last time buying from you 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
good transmit audio 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
worst phone ever 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
good case 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
excellent product 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
very displeased 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
no real improvement 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
will not be back 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
worst phone ever 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1
