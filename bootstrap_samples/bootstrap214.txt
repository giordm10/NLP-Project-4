director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
service sucks 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
how awesome is that 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
i will not return 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
never going back 0 
not my thing 0 
go watch it 1 
great movie 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
dont do it 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
great movie 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
go watch it 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
excellent product 1 
the battery works great 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
very displeased 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the battery works great 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
what a big waste of time 0 
not a good bargain 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
that was nice 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
a bit predictable 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
great sound and service 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
dont do it 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this place has it 1 
i will not return 0 
poor quality and service 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
this place is great 1 
love it great armband 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
this place is great 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
love it great armband 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i wont be back 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
either way it sucks 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
great product 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i love it 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
good transmit audio 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1

this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
excellent short film 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
brilliant 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
will order from them again 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
good case 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
great movie 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
excellent short film 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
go watch it 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0

the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
that was nice 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
will order from them again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
the battery works great 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1

how awesome is that 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
love it great armband 1
