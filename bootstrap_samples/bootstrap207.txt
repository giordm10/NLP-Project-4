as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
fantastic service here 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
a bit predictable 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
go and see it 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i wont be back 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
great product 1 
great charger 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
worst phone ever 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i will not return 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
the battery works great 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
not enough volume 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
great bluetooth 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
its a great item 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
not a good bargain 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
works great 1 
this place has it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great sound and service 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
i wont be back 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i want my money back 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
crisp and clear 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
great phone 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
great movie 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
soggy and not good 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
excellent product 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
great phone 1 
good servicecheck 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clich√©s to be admitted elsewhere 0 
no real improvement 0 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i wont be back 0 
cool phone 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
great movie 1 
not my thing 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
great charger 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
good servicecheck 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
brilliant 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
will not be back 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
great charger 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
good servicecheck 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
that was nice 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
good servicecheck 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1

nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1

anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
a bit predictable 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
good transmit audio 1 
not enough volume 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
worthwhile 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
fantastic service here 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
omit watching this 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
fantastic service here 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1

this is a stunning movie 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
service sucks 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
google mediocre and i imagine smashburger will pop up 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
good servicecheck 1 
great phone 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0

it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
worthwhile 1 
last time buying from you 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
cool phone 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
how awesome is that 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1

the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1
