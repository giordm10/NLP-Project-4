protects the phone on all sides 1 
fantastic service here 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this place has it 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the battery works great 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
great product 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
will not be back 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
very displeased 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
great charger 1 
better than new 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
good case 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
not enough volume 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
its a great item 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of qu√©bec 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
poor quality and service 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
that was nice 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
great charger 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
a bit predictable 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
i wont be back 0 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
last time buying from you 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
bacon is hella salty 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very displeased 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
will be back again 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
brilliant 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
excellent short film 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
excellent product 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
not enough volume 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
great sound and service 1 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0

never going back 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
not my thing 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
worthwhile 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0

the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1

conclusion i loved it 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
works great 1

the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1

it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1

it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
service sucks 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1

the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
worthwhile 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
poor quality and service 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0

all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani ¬ñ particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
warning do not buy 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
and it was way to expensive 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
great product 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
fantastic service here 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0
