the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
no real improvement 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
no real improvement 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
good transmit audio 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
i want my money back 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
great bluetooth 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
excellent product 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
not a good bargain 0 
brilliant 1 
cool phone 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
it is very comfortable on the ear 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
good case 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
not enough volume 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
excellent short film 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
omit watching this 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
everything is appalling 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1

anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
not my thing 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i want my money back 0 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
how awesome is that 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
service sucks 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0

i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1

hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
great phone 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0

their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1

thank you for such great service 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
good case 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
this place has it 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
either way it sucks 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
great product 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0

and it was way to expensive 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0

i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
either way it sucks 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0

i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
good transmit audio 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
great charger 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
will order from them again 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
very displeased 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
great charger 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
this place is great 1 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
great sound and service 1 
she is as lovely as usual this cutie 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
soggy and not good 0 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
will order from them again 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
great phone 1 
last time buying from you 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
a bit predictable 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i want my money back 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i could not recommend these more 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
excellent product 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1
