hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
great charger 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this place has it 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
great charger 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
omit watching this 0 
how awesome is that 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
good transmit audio 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
no real improvement 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
and the drinks are weak people 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1

dont waste your money and time 0 
good servicecheck 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1

it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1

great pizza and salads 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1

the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
great phone 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0

i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
i want my money back 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
that was nice 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
soggy and not good 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
the battery works great 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1

manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
excellent product 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
no real improvement 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
no real improvement 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
its dumb and pointless and a complete waste of time 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
a bit predictable 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1

great movie 1 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0

excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0

final word this show is a real torture 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
no real improvement 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
worthwhile 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
either way it sucks 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0

however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1

good case 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
works great 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1

a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great bluetooth 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
how awesome is that 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
poor quality and service 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
better than new 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
everything is appalling 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
poor quality and service 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
talk about useless customer service 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
great charger 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
everything is appalling 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1
