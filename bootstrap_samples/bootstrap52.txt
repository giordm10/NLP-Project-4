i love it 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
great phone 1 
everything is appalling 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
good servicecheck 1 
cool phone 1

excellent short film 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
very displeased 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
worthwhile 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
brilliant 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
good case 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not enough volume 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
excellent product for the price 1 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
last time buying from you 0 
ive had better atmosphere 0 
cool phone 1 
poor quality and service 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
worthwhile 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
technically the film is well made with impressive camerawork solid acting and effective music from riz ortolani  particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like its coming from a distant hill 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
good servicecheck 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
good transmit audio 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
i wont be back 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
fantastic service here 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
that was nice 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
its a great item 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
either way it sucks 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
those burgers were amazing 1 
fantastic service here 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
great product 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
good servicecheck 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
cool phone 1 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
either way it sucks 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
omit watching this 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
love it great armband 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
not a good bargain 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
either way it sucks 0 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the movie i received was a great quality film for its age 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
fantastic service here 1 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
i liked the way dustin hoffmans character was ready to do just about everything to stay with his son 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
dont do it 0 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
great movie 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
will not be back 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
a great way to finish a great 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
love it great armband 1 
very displeased 0 
will order from them again 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
it lacked flavor seemed undercooked and dry 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
will not be back 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0

its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
my phone sounded ok not great ok but my wifes phone was almost totally unintelligible she couldnt understand a word being said on it 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
either way it sucks 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the lighting is awful 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
last time buying from you 0 
no real improvement 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
worst phone ever 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
the battery works great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
works great 1 
as much as id like to go back i cant get passed the atrocious service and will never return 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
excellent product 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0

lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
that was nice 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
good servicecheck 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1

the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
manna from heaven is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1

i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0

conclusion i loved it 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
but then they came back cold 0 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0
