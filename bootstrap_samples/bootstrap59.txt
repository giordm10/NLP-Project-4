clear crisp sound 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
excellent product 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
good case 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
what a big waste of time 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
everything is appalling 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
battery is holding up well 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if someone orders two tacos dont you think it may be part of customer service to ask if it is combo or ala cart 0 
i want my money back 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
great phone 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
omit watching this 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
good transmit audio 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
either way it sucks 0 
tmobile has the best customer service anywhere 1 
do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1

cool phone 1 
crisp and clear 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the heart attack grill in downtown vegas is an absolutely flatlined excuse for a restaurant 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
sauce was tasteless 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0

i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
crisp and clear 1 
great bluetooth 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
worthwhile 1 
that was nice 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
go watch it 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
go watch it 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
love it great armband 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
definitely a bargain 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
how awesome is that 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1

and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i bought these hoping i could make my bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear 0 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i love it 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
go and see it 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
generous portions and great taste 1 
the battery works great 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
i love the decor with the chinese calligraphy wall paper 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
will be back again 1 
i could not recommend these more 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
fantastic service here 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
go watch it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
it feels more comfortable than most headsets because i wear glasses and that gets in the way sometimes 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
great phone 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
good case 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
the chipolte ranch dipping sause was tasteless seemed thin and watered down with no heat 0 
great pizza and salads 1 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
service was slow and not attentive 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
i want my money back 0 
but this movie really got to me 1 
soggy and not good 0 
i will not return 0 
i want my money back 0 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
go and see it 1 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
better than new 1 
never going back 0 
i want my money back 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
brilliant 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i am more than happy with this product 1 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
poor quality and service 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
soggy and not good 0 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1

i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
i will not return 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
i definitly recommend 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
good transmit audio 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it was very popular when i was in the cinema a good house and very good reactions and plenty of laughs 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
nice spicy and tender 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
virgin wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
i will not return 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1

omit watching this 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
there was nothing believable about it at all 0 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
excellent short film 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1

three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
real sushi lovers lets be honest yama is not that good 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
great bluetooth 1 
they also now serve indian naan bread with hummus and some spicy pine nut sauce that was out of this world 1 
excellent product 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
love it great armband 1 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
not enough volume 0 
great product 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
crisp and clear 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1
