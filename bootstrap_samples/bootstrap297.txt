kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
ill be drivng along and my headset starts ringing for no reason 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
never going back 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
worthwhile 1 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
soggy and not good 0 
as a european the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences i had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1

hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
fantastic service here 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
the kids are very cool too 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
very little music or anything to speak of 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
the battery works great 1 
our server was fantastic and when he found out the wife loves roasted garlic and bone marrow he added extra to our meal and another marrow to go 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
that was nice 1 
excellent short film 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
love the margaritas too 1 
this place has it 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1

excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
service sucks 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
good case 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
and then tragedy struck 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i got food poisoning here at the buffet 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
wont ever go here again 0 
i have a verizon lg phone and they work well together good reception and range that exceeds 20 feet line of sight 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
i had to purchase a different case 0 
not enough volume 0 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
brilliant 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
that was nice 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
not a good bargain 0 
great product 1 
this is definitely one of the bad ones 0 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i really enjoyed crema caf√© before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
not enough volume 0 
nice spicy and tender 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurv√•g being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
good case 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
the script looks as if only a rough draft was written and shooting began before a finished script was completed 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the character developments also lacked in depth 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
no real improvement 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
also i feel like the chips are bought not made in house 0 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
better than new 1 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
worst phone ever 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
great bluetooth 1 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
i does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap 0 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
warning do not buy 0 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1

but then they came back cold 0 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
i wont be back 0 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1

the rest of the cast also play well 1 
brilliant 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
cool phone 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
1 it works 2 it is comfortable 1 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0

just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
best buffet in town for the price you cannot beat it 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
i definitly recommend 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
clear crisp sound 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
i was hoping for more 0 
i loved this movie it was a great portrayal of a family who had its share of ups and down but in the end they knew that special love they had for each other 1 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
go and see it 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
everything is appalling 0 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
dont do it 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
good case 1 
great pizza and salads 1 
three of the most visually appealing movies ive ever seen 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
the battery works great 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
service was fine and the waitress was friendly 1 
better than new 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1
