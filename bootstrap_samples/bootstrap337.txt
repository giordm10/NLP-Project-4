its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
sprint terrible customer service 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
we loved the biscuits 1 
i posted more detailed comments under the grey or black phone but i have the fire red and its a great color 1 
service sucks 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
cool phone 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
boy was that sucker dry 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
not enough volume 0 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
either way it sucks 0 
if you are looking for a movie with a terrific cast some good musicincluding a shirley jones rendition of the way you look tonight and an uplifting ending give this one a try 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the commercials are the most misleading 0 
fantastic service here 1 
i love it 1 
sadly gordon ramseys steak is a place we shall sharply avoid during our next trip to vegas 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
based on the subpar service i received and no effort to show their gratitude for my business i wont be going back 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
will order from them again 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
hawaiian breeze mango magic and pineapple delight are the smoothies that ive tried so far and theyre all good 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
i great reception all the time 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
cool phone 1 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
really really good rice all the time 1 
this is one of the best bars with food in vegas 1 
that was nice 1 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
good case 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the directing is sloppy at best 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i great reception all the time 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i wont be back 0 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
always a pleasure dealing with him 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
thank you for such great service 1 
this place has it 1 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
good servicecheck 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
if you want a movie thats not gross but gives you some chills this is a great choice 1 
never going back 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i was very impressed with the price of the cases 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
that one didnt work either 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
the staff is super nice and very quick even with the crazy crowds of the downtown juries lawyers and court staff 1 
after waiting an hour and being seated i was not in the greatest of moods 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
thoroughly disappointed 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
great charger 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
great charger 1 
i got this phone around the end of may and im completely unhappy with it 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
clear crisp sound 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
warning do not buy 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
will order from them again 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
will not be back 0 
will order from them again 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
conclusion i loved it 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
not a good bargain 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
jimmy stewart is as ever a great hero for hitchcock the story rips along to its cool climax at an embassy function but it lacks the brooding menace of hitchcocks black and white lowbudget original 1 
stopped by this place while in madison for the ironman very friendly kind staff 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
i wont be back 0 
soggy and not good 0 
i love it 1 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
no buyers remorse on this one 0 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
cool phone 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
worthwhile 1 
a great way to finish a great 1 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
good transmit audio 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
and it was way to expensive 0 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
the case is a flimsy piece of plastic and has no front or side protection whatsoever 0 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
good case 1 
director neil labute uses brutal violence to seperate dreams from reality and along with the touching drama and hilarious comedy you can never tell what is going to happen next 1 
now i am getting angry and i want my damn pho 0 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
does not charge the cingular att 8525 phone 0 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
buy a different phone but not this 0 
the one down note is the ventilation could use some upgrading 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
this product is very high quality chinese crap 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
its close to my house its lowkey nonfancy affordable prices good food 1 
will go back next trip out 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
great phone 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
it works great with a car charger especially if you cannot plug in two adapters at the same time 1 
i miss it and wish they had one in philadelphia 1 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
a couple of months later i returned and had an amazing meal 1 
thats a huge design flaw unless im not using it correctly which i dont think is the case 0 
that was nice 1 
i usually dont like headbands but this one is very lightweight doesnt mess up my hair 1 
will be back again 1 
plus with the movies rather modest budget and fast running time it does an amazing job 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i just got bored watching jessice lange take her clothes off 0 
you cant even tell if they have any talent because they not only have pathetic lines to speak but the director gave them no action 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
clipping this to your belt will deffinitely make you feel like 50 cents upandcoming 1 
if you act in such a film you should be glad that youre gonna drift away from earth as far as possible 0 
a bit predictable 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
go and see it 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
warning do not buy 0 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
we loved the biscuits 1 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
they know how to make them here 1 
but this movie really got to me 1 
its a great place and i highly recommend it 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
excellently produced by one of scifis best producers scot vandiver 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
excellent product for the price 1 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
excellent wallet type phone case 1 
the patio seating was very comfortable 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
sauce was tasteless 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
wont ever go here again 0 
this is a very right on case movie that delivers everything almost right in your face 1 
works great 1 
the staff are now not as friendly the wait times for being served are horrible no one even says hi for the first 10 minutes 0 
display is excellent and camera is as good as any from that year 1 
they know how to make them here 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i loved the bacon wrapped dates 1 
i have this phone and it is a thorn in my side i really abhor it 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
all in all a beautiful directed film from nicolas roeg wih a sublime cast 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
it was extremely crumby and pretty tasteless 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
the place was not clean and the food oh so stale 0 
angus scrimm also turns in a good performance in a somewhat brief but memorable role as the gently menacing violinplaying anatomist doctor quinn 1 
avoid at all cost 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
the last 3 times i had lunch here has been bad 0 
so we went to tigerlilly and had a fantastic afternoon 1 
the battery works great 1 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
i have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one 1 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
dont waste your money and time 0 
will not be back 0 
conclusion i loved it 1 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1

please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the kids play area is nasty 0

either way it sucks 0 
however there was so much garlic in the fondue it was barely edible 0 
excellent short film 1 
the film looks cheap and bland 0 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
great product 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
the rest of the movie lacks art charm meaning if its about emptiness it works i guess because its empty 0 
best bluetooth on the market 1

the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0

one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
just had lunch here and had a great experience 1 
in a most wonderful location lies a story of contrast 1 
an excellent performance from ms 1 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
the wontons were thin not thick and chewy almost melt in your mouth 1 
not my thing 0
