basically the service was very bad 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
this is one i did not have but i watched it recently on fox movie channel and was very disappointed 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
this was my first crawfish experience and it was delicious 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
dont trust their website and dont expect any helpful support 0 
all three broke within two months of use 0 
i have been here several times in the past and the experience has always been great 1 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the suspense builders were good just cross the line from g to pg 1 
will be back again 1 
and none of the tones is acceptable 0 
the best scene in the movie is at the end but i wont spoil it 1 
good case 1 
their network coverage in los angeles is horrible 0 
anyway this fs restaurant has a wonderful breakfastlunch 1 
i dont know what happened in season five what a mess 0 
one of the most boringpointless movies i have ever seen 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
worst phone ever 0 
conceptually the show offers a little bit of everything and for just about everybody parents kids fantasy andor fx fans 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i wouldnt recommend buying this product 0 
by this point my friends and i had basically figured out this place was a joke and didnt mind making it publicly and loudly known 0 
thank you for such great service 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
this place is a jewel in las vegas and exactly what ive been hoping to find in nearly ten years living here 1 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
battery is holding up well 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
and then tragedy struck 0 
every time i eat here i see caring teamwork to a professional degree 1 
the seafood was fresh and generous in portion 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
however my recent experience at this particular location was not so good 0 
overall i was very disappointed with the quality of food at bouchon 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
best bluetooth on the market 1 
i have used several phone in two years but this one is the best 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
its very attractive and appears to be of good quality 1 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great movie 1 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
great charger 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
bacon is hella salty 1 
still it was the sets that got a big 10 on my oyvey scale 1 
nicest chinese restaurant ive been in a while 1 
it fits comfortably in either ear the sound is clear and loud and the charge lasts a couple of days 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i had always known that errol flynn was a brilliant actor as he was my dads favourite actor and i grew up watching his films as a child 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
ironically i mostly find his films a total waste of time to watch 0 
our waiter was very attentive friendly and informative 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
that one didnt work either 0 
never going back 0 
this place is great 1 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
love it great armband 1 
go and see it 1 
i know that jim oconnor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him but george was well dull 0 
the wife hated her meal coconut shrimp and our friends really did not enjoy their meals either 0 
worthwhile 1 
ill take my business dinner dollars elsewhere 0 
our server was very nice and attentive as were the other serving staff 1 
generous portions and great taste 1 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
he can bore you to pieces and kill the momentum of a movie quicker than anyone else 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
awkward to use and unreliable 0 
one of the few places in phoenix that i would definately go back to again 1 
i wont try going back there even if its empty 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i also had to taste my moms multigrain pumpkin pancakes with pecan butter and they were amazing fluffy and delicious 1 
ursula burtons portrayal of the nun is both touching and funny at the same time with out making fun of nuns or the church 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
the only real effects work is the presence of all the animals and the integration of those into the scenes is some of the worst and most obvious bluegreenscreen work ive ever seen 0 
his on screen presence shined thought even though there were other senior actors on the screen with him 1 
please stay away from the shrimp stir fried noodles 0 
the kids are very cool too 1 
a lassie movie which should have been put to sleep forever 0 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
give it a try you will be happy you did 1 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
theres a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that i have never experienced before 0 
never going back 0 
but i recommend waiting for their future efforts let this one go 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
it is not just a cult it is a cult classic 1 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
this is not moviemaking 0 
im glad this pretentious piece of s didnt do as planned by the dodge stratus big shots its gonna help movie makers who arent in the very restrained movie business of québec 0 
i used to talk on it for 1 1 12 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying 0 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i would definitely recommend the wings as well as the pizza 1 
we could not believe how dirty the oysters were 0 
the reception through this headset is excellent 1 
the chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside 1 
linda cardellini is the only thing good in this film 1 
if you like a loud buzzing to override all your conversations then this phone is for you 0 
everything is appalling 0 
final word this show is a real torture 0 
i gave it a 10 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
i didnt think that the instructions provided were helpful to me 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
excellent short film 1 
poor quality and service 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
poor quality and service 0 
for about 10 minutes we were waiting for her salad when we realized that it wasnt coming any time soon 0 
really really good rice all the time 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
every single character was hilarious and deserved to be called a lead 1 
i had the opportunity today to sample your amazing pizzas 1 
the sets are so bad they wouldnt look out of place on a thunderbirds episode 0 
vivian schilling did an excellent job with the script 1 
the keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough i dont expect any problems 1 
anyway i do not think i will go back there 0 
this place is two thumbs upway up 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
paying 785 for a hot dog and fries that looks like it came out of a kids meal at the wienerschnitzel is not my idea of a good meal 0 
this is not moviemaking 0 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
stanwyck and morgan are perfectly cast in what is in many ways a modern equivalent of dickens christmas carol in its sensibility 1 
i was very uneasy with how bad this movie was but not scared at all 0 
a lady at the table next to us found a live green caterpillar in her salad 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
its as continuously beautiful to look at as a bertolucci but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that masters work 1 
fantastic service here 1 
needless to say i wasted my money 0 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i found this product to be waaay too big 0 
this is definitely a must have if your state does not allow cell phone usage while driving 1 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
it has everything you could want suspense drama comedy confusing subplots native americans brain eating if youre looking for the beall endall of brainsucking movies look no further 1 
the replacement died in a few weeks 0 
tom wilkinsons character is a man who is not prepared for the ordeal that is about to begin but he takes the matter in hand as the story progresses and this great actor gives a performance that makes you feel the characters anguish and suffering 1 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
so mediocre in every aspect that it just becomes a dull uninteresting mess this is one of the most forgettable movies ive seen 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
it handles some tough issues with dignity and grace and of course has shocking spoiler here 1 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the result is a film that just dont look right 0 
and quite honestly often its not very good 0 
they had a toro tartare with a cavier that was extraordinary and i liked the thinly sliced wagyu with white truffle 1 
if the two were seperated by a mere 5 ft i started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset 0 
the lighting is awful 0 
great for using with your home stereo 1 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
the food was very good and i enjoyed every mouthful an enjoyable relaxed venue for couples small family groups etc 1 
hopefully the director james cox can turn the short into a feature length film with the same cast or win us over with a whole new film 1 
also the music by mark snow is possibly the best score ive ever heard 1 
julian fellowes has triumphed again 1 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
will go back next trip out 1 
i can hear while im driving in the car and usually dont even have to put it on its loudest setting 1 
overall i dont think that i would take my parents to this place again because they made most of the similar complaints that i silently felt too 0 
provides good protection and looks classy too 1 
works like a charm works as advertised 1 
the dialogue is atrocious 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
the guy who said hes had better dialogue with his potted plants has it right 0 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
this place has it 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
works great 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
the rest of the cast also play well 1 
great bluetooth 1 
the item received was counterfeit 0 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
i personally love the hummus pita baklava falafels and baba ganoush its amazing what they do with eggplant 1 
worst phone ever 0 
they have a good selection of food including a massive meatloaf sandwich a crispy chicken wrap a delish tuna melt and some tasty burgers 1 
i want my money back 0 
i have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
i couldnt take them seriously 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
great sound and service 1 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
i have watched their prices inflate portions get smaller and management attitudes grow rapidly 0 
at least 40min passed in between us ordering and the food arriving and it wasnt that busy 0 
great place to have a couple drinks and watch any and all sporting events as the walls are covered with tvs 1 
i was hoping for more 0 
there are some generally great things in it 1 
go and see it 1 
plus i seriously do not believe it is worth its steep price point 0 
the look of it is very sharp and the screen is nice and clear with great graphics 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0 
this was a flick doomed from its conception 0 
battery life still not long enough in motorola razor v3i 0 
dont be afraid of subtitles its worth a little aversion therapy 1010 1 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
love the margaritas too 1 
the atmosphere here is fun 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
not a single employee came out to see if we were ok or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food 0 
my colleague i now get great receptiona little expensive but performance is great 1 
i bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery 0 
this movie is wellbalanced with comedy and drama and i thoroughly enjoyed myself 1 
the battery works great 1 
the internet access was fine it the rare instance that it worked 0 
in short this was a monumental waste of time and energy and i would not recommend anyone to ever see this film 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0 
protects the phone on all sides 1 
this movie is a pure disaster the story is stupid and the editing is the worst i have seen it confuses you incredibly 0 
but it is entertaining nonetheless 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
thats rightthe red velvet cakeohhh this stuff is so good 1 
excellent product i am very satisfied with the purchase 1 
the one big drawback of the mp3 player is that the buttons on the phones front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds 0 
i wouldnt say theyre worth 2 hours of your time though 0 
this product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive 1 
i am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone 0 
the case is great and works fine with the 680 1 
they also have the best cheese crisp in town 1 
i loved the grilled pizza reminded me of legit italian pizza 1 
it would take too long to describe how bad my customer service experience has been with amazon 0 
this movie is so mindbendingly awful it couldnt have even been created 0 
authentic leather with nice shine and comfort i recommend you this case 1 
worst phone ever 0 
but this understated film leaves a lasting impression 1 
last time buying from you 0 
cool phone 1 
this is a stunning movie 1 
buy it play it enjoy it love it 1 
you can not answer calls with the unit never worked once 0 
dont waste your money and time 0 
it didnt charge for me 0 
better than new 1 
it took over 30 min to get their milkshake which was nothing more than chocolate milk 0 
no allergy warnings on the menu and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1 
it didnt charge for me 0 
i plugged it in only to find out not a darn thing worked 0 
i highly doubt that anyone could ever like this trash 0 
the phone can also take great pictures and even video clips 1 
fantastic service here 1 
dont do it 0 
not frightening in the least and barely comprehensible 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
this place is great 1 
the deal included 5 tastings and 2 drinks and jeff went above and beyond what we expected 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
shot in the southern california desert using his patent faux documentary style watkins creates a film like no other 1 
just consider the excellent story solid acting and look of the film as added bonuses 1 
much better than the hard plastic cases 1 
warning do not buy 0 
will not be back 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i want my money back 0 
never had anything to complain about here 1 
i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
plan on ordering from them again and again 1 
i certainly do not mean this distinction in a good way 0 
the buffet is small and all the food they offered was bland 0 
i really enjoyed crema café before they expanded i even told friends they had the best breakfast 1 
basically the service was very bad 0 
i dont think ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk 0 
worst software ever used if i could give this zero stars i would 0 
good servicecheck 1 
the fat computer geek was unbelievable the bible thumper the badass girl who are these actors 0 
i only used it two days and it wasnt always easy to hear with 0 
great phone 1 
this is the number one best th game in the series 1 
no real improvement 0 
everything worked on the first trythe device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good 1 
if you want to wait for mediocre food and downright terrible service then this is the place for you 0 
worse of all he humiliated his worker right in front of mebunch of horrible name callings 0 
it is a film about nothing just a pretext to show ridiculous action scenes 0 
i came out of it feeling angry 0 
however here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up 0 
i think food should have flavor and texture and both were lacking 0 
great subway in fact its so good when you come here every other subway will not meet your expectations 1 
she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door 0 
overall this movie was cheap trash 0 
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides costcos 0 
go watch it 1 
ive had better bagels from the grocery store 0 
obviously there is a problem with the adhesive 0 
ive lived here since 1979 and this was the first and last time ive stepped foot into this place 0 
the ambiance here did not feel like a buffet setting but more of a douchey indoor garden for tea and biscuits 0 
i probably wont be back to be honest 0 
i ordered this product first and was unhappy with it immediately 0 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
as they say in canada this is the fun game aye 1 
good servicecheck 1 
its very convenient and simple to use gets job done makes the car ride so much smoother 1 
i love it 1 
talk about useless customer service 0 
this is a stunning movie 1 
soggy and not good 0 
the picture resolution is far below what other comparablypriced phones are offering today 0 
those burgers were amazing 1 
definitely a bargain 1 
this movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way 0 
the original body and soul 1947 is a masterpiece 1 
but then they came back cold 0 
kathy bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism a variation on her character in at play in the fields of the lord 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
brilliant 1 
not only will it drain your player but may also potentially fry it 0

we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
excellent short film 1 
and i forgot the casting here i superb with trond fausa aurvåg being perfect in the role as the bothersome man who doesnt understand where he is what he is doing and why 1 
the characters were very stagey and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce 0 
overpriced for what you are getting 0 
after receiving and using the product for just 2 days it broke 0 
the cutouts and buttons are placed perfectly 1 
will order from them again 1 
but tiny toons kept the 90s vibe and delivered one of the most popular funny and underrated cartoons ever created 1 
today is the second time ive been to their lunch buffet and it was pretty good 1 
my father has the v265 and the battery is dying 0 
great food for the price which is very high quality and house made 1 
we were sat right on time and our server from the get go was fantastic 1 
when i first watched this movie in the 80s i loved it 1 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
unfortunately its easy to accidentally activate them with the gentletouch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening 0 
also there are combos like a burger fries and beer for 23 which is a decent deal 1 
prices are very reasonable flavors are spot on the sauce is home made and the slaw is not drenched in mayo 1 
i gave it a 10 1 
the battery works great 1 
even billy bob couldnt rise above the script which was worse 0 
poor service the waiter made me feel like i was stupid every time he came to the table 0 
i love it 1 
this show is made for americans it is too stupid and full with hatred and clichés to be admitted elsewhere 0 
it actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as blist horrorsuspense films go 1 
the food is delicious and just spicy enough so be sure to ask for spicier if you prefer it that way 1

i was looking for this headset for a long time and now that ive got it i couldnt be happier 1 
lobster bisque bussell sprouts risotto filet all needed salt and pepperand of course there is none at the tables 0 
avoid at all cost 0 
great bluetooth 1 
still it makes up for all of this with a super ending that depicts a great sea vessel being taken out by the mighty frost 1 
this one just fails to create any real suspense 0 
the film lacks any real scares or tension some of the medical terminology used throughout is a bit iffy to say the least i say that as an insulin dependant diabetic myself 0 
looks good in the picture but this case was a huge disappointment 0
